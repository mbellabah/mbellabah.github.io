Henry George remains my favorite writer on political economy. Some might consider him and his thoughts idealistic, but it's precisely that sensible and optimistic humanism that so moves me.A collection of essays, Social Problems, expands on George's critique of economic inequality and the failures of existing institutions in addressing poverty despite various societal and technological advancements: "The Paradox of Progress". In it, George delivers prescient analyses on role of government and democracy, the "land question", social reform and education, and the tendency to industrial concentration/monopoly, all the while maintaining his through, clear, and engaging writing throughout.Everything reads as so sensible that I wouldn't be shocked if you walk away thinking "how are we not already doing all this??"I'd recommend reading this before wrestling with his seminal [b:Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry in the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth...
