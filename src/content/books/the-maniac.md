Great book with beautiful writing. Some interesting lines in there on topics that require further personal investigation — will be thinking much about formal systems in the coming weeks.Debated between 4 and 5 stars since the momentum of the book petered slightly towards the end. Finally, it was the many well-done metaphors that tipped the scales.Good (fictional) continuation having read [b:The General and the Genius: Groves and Oppenheimer—The Unlikely Partnership that Built the Atom Bomb|23258873|The General and the Genius Groves and Oppenheimer—The Unlikely Partnership that Built the Atom Bomb|James W.
