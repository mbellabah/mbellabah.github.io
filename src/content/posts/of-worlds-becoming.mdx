Heavy is the head that wears the crown,

Forged of lofty expectations,

And sagged are the shoulders,

Underneath a world unborn,

But heavier still,

Are man and his dreams taken together,

Sat astride the beast of burden,

Unduly saddled,

With a load not its own,

And yet, the crown gleams,

With a fragile promise,

So the mule trudges forward,

With a strength that lies not in conquering,

But in bearing--persistently, quietly--

The immeasurable weight of a world becoming.
