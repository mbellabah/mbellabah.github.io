Is technology not innate to us

as webs are to the patient spider's craft?

We weave our networks, ever more complex,

both born of instinct, shaped by nature's law.

<br/>

But here we part from spider's ancient art:

our webs, sprung of that same primal need,

become the snares that hold us fastâ€”

indeed, never have I heard

of a spider strangled in its silk.
