O Lord,

Steer me through affairs of the heart,

Mine vessel I surrender to thee,

Take from me the wheel,

Bind me steadfast to the bowsprit,

So my weeping, 

Tears akin to mortal rain,

May fall harmlessly into the ocean below,

And not flood this ship,

Lord,

Guide me through matters of the heart,

And see me safe to shore.
