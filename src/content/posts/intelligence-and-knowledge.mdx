I was in Hawaii a couple weekends ago with the usual suspects of mine. We'd been invited by one of said suspects who had fled the prison (San Francisco, Bay Area) to settle her new life with her new fiancé and home in Hawaii. It was a fantastic trip—my ears were plugged from seawater nearly the entirety of it and I was almost permanently damp from swimming every day in the Pacific. As far as Bella trips go, it was unsurprising that a philosophical discussion arose somehow. This time, on intelligence. Fitting, given the daily advancements (and marketing) of AI and ML.

## Introduction
We often speak of intelligence as if it’s synonymous with knowledge. But supposing we had to distinguish between them on threat of life and property, how might we do so? To me: knowledge feels like something that is accumulated over time, often through repetition or exposure. Intelligence, on the other hand, resembles the substrate or foundation upon which such accumulation is possible. The distinction matters because one can grow indefinitely, while the other appears fixed—or at least fixed within a lifetime, or a hardware generation.


## What Raw Intelligence Might Be
If there is such a thing as “raw” intelligence, it’s the capacity to store, retrieve, and manipulate information with both speed and accuracy. In computing terms, it’s akin to memory bandwidth and processor efficiency—how fast a machine can ingest, compress, and reassemble data into something coherent.

Large language models, or any transformer-based architectures for that matter, can be graded by this principle. Their “memory bandwidth” roughly correlates to their number of parameters. A machine with vast storage but slow retrieval is knowledgeable but dull. A machine with limited knowledge but fast inference is inexperienced but snappy.

I emphasize speed because speed determines verifiability. If I give you a test of intelligence, the number of tests I can run in your lifetime determines the confidence of my measurement. The slower you are, the fewer observations I can collect, and thus the larger the statistical asterisk attached to my belief about your intelligence. For machines–which have no real capacity to be impatient–I might verify constantly, or as my friend puts it **constant proof by example**.

## Outcome vs Process
Most measures of intelligence conflate outcome with process. IQ tests, standardized exams, even the Turing Test—these are all outcome-based. Did the entity produce the correct answer? Did it fool you into thinking it’s human? A system can brute-force its way to passing these tests through memorization, which is knowledge masquerading as intelligence.

The more interesting definition of intelligence lies in how an entity generalizes beyond prior experience. It’s not whether it knows, but whether it can predict. Prediction sits at the core of all intelligent behavior—from catching a ball to writing an essay to steering a spacecraft. Knowledge fuels prediction, but the act of leaping across uncertainty is the signature of intelligence.



Yes, but it assumes that intelligence is based on outcome. Turing test is classic example: if an entity behind curtains succeeds at convincing you it’s a person simply by you conversing with it, it is “intelligent” in the same way you might be.

What I think is a lot more nuanced than that:

1. I think there is such thing as raw intelligence which refers to your ability to store information and quickly recall it. Much in the same way that a computer with more RAM is on paper more performant than one with less

2. There are dimensions of intelligence. These are correlated with baseline intelligence but not necessarily strongly so

3. A better outcome based measure for intelligence is one’s ability to accurately “predict the future” of several classes of prediction problems

Ya, he was making the point that any measure for intelligence can be gamed in such a way that it’s not a reliable measure of intelligence—ie a machine can just memorize all the knowledge. Because he distinguishes between “knowledge” and “intelligence”, he’d probably assert that any supposed test of intelligence is really just a test of knowledge, eg IQ tests, etc 
Told nothing else and supposing that this is completely new material for both of them, I’d assume:

Person B who only studied one hour is more intelligent as they “needed” less time to attain some result. They are more efficient than person A as we can verify their results sooner and test them more within a lifetime. This means I can be more confident as to how intelligent they are as opposed to person A whose intelligence Id need to discount slightly on lack of data.

That said, it’s also possible that person A’s character is one where they’re either more anxious or need to feel more prepared, in which case they’re as intelligent as B and could also get by with studying only one hour if only they convinced themselves they could/should
I also don’t think that’s true. 

I’ll contradict myself somewhat, but a person who is capable of studying/focusing for 12 hours probably has a level of work ethic and focus that actually means they’re more intelligent. Their raw intelligence might be higher (as ability to remember all that information and be able to efficient recall is raw computation power)
