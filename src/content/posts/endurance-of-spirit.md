Man is first pliable,

Only when compelled to run through natureâ€™s course,

Through her crags and bramble, and under an angry sun and an inhospitable cold,

Is he made firm, sharp, and with purpose,

Just as the sword gains its shape under hammer blows,

Finds its edge in the whetstone,

And its bite when put to task.
