There is a certain arrogance in man,

That has him believe,

Despite all, that he will make it happen,

But like a deluge wherefor man would fix a dam in prevention,

God humbles him,

For God intended man prostrate and not dictate the universe.

But there are times,

When the will of man is so concentrated as to be made potent,

And his soul cries so loud,

That the hearing God obligingly observes the covenant that exchanges manâ€™s unbridled passion for His favor,

So that all that which need not happen, is rewritten to be.
