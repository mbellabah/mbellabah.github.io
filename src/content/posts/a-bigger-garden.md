A man tended his garden, lost in routine

When fluttered in a butterfly, unannounced,

More brilliant than anything he’d ever seen,

Entranced, he laid down his shears,

And proclaimed: “O’ butterfly, I’d sow the whole Earth,

So you might always alight,

Gently upon a flower’s petal,

And if your wings ever grew weary, 

I’d plead the wind whisper you ease,

And failing that, gladly give whatever I possess in my lungs.”

But of course, the butterfly’s visit was brief,

Drifting from his garden almost as soon as it’d arrived,

And so goes how a man, true to his promise,

Having willingly surrendered to an all-consuming, selfish love,

Transformed Earth into an Eden,

But just as in scripture,

Only for two.
