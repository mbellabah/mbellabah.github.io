# MIT 6.867 2019 Poster
In broad terms, our project explores adversarial attacks on machine learning models. We do so first in a toy “gaussian” setting, then in an image CIFAR-10 setting.
* Toy setting: a “adversary” attempts to uncover a distribution hidden by a “challenger”.
* Image Setting: training data reconstruction. We aim to reconstruct a single datapoint (image) within the dataset that the target model was trained on.
