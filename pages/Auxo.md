I've been privately working on the technical aspects of **Auxo** (Project Auxo) on-and-off for quite a while now. That said, friends, family, and strangers are usually more interested in what Auxo means as a business as opposed to a technical project. Fortunately, StartMIT 2021[^1] offered the structured time to work on Auxo's narrative, its customer segment, its value proposition, and its position in the electricity/energy industry now and into the future. In two-and-a-half weeks, with the help of two friends, Mussie Demisse and Adedayo Aderibole, we laid the foundation for what will hopefully become a compelling narrative surrounding a valuable and innovative business. 

We recorded the following presentation shortly after presenting privately to our StartMIT cohort.
