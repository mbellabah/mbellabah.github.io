Hey hey <span class="wave">üëãüèø</span> My name is **Mohamadou Bella Bah**! 

I'm a junior (2021) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu) pursuing my bachelors (SB) and masters (MEng) in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu). 

- I'm an engineer, and software developer by training.  
- I think about energy and electric grids, **alot**. 
- I'm a system level thinker, and I don't hesitate from thinking about things on a **global** level. 
- I think everything should be treated as a multi-agent system. 


### My Background

I'm from Sierra Leone but was born in Guinea, Conakry. Thanks to my parents' work, I've had the amazing priviledge of having lived in nearly a dozen countries, spanning four of the seven continents. 

Here's a map of where I've lived, along with a list.
