Hey hey <span class="wave">👋🏿</span> My name is **Mohamadou Bella Bah**.  

I'm a junior (2021) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) pursuing my bachelors (SB) and masters (MEng) in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu). 

I'm an engineer by training, who thinks about energy, electric grids, multiagent-systems, and AI. Alot. As a system level thinker, I don't shy away from thinking about things **globally** 🌎. 

I'm currently researching with the [Active Adaptive Control Laboratory](http://aaclab.mit.edu) (AACLAB) at MIT, with funding from the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI). My work with the lab is concerned with how to pair independent agents together in a multiagent system. More specifically, in the context of an electric grid, the idea is that privately owned solar-panels and batteries ought to automatically pair with one another to form a more flexible and less volatile, hybrid asset. I'm writing a service that imbues a solar-panel, and a battery, with the necessary "intelligence" to engage one another in such a relationship. Now, this would be difficult if I had to build the communications infrastructure and underlying intelligence from the ground up! Fortunately, this service can be run on the Auxo Olympus Platform, which is an "edge-computing" platform that I developed! 


You can take a look at my research poster in the `work/posters` section of this website. It goes into some detail regarding services running on the Auxo platform. To learn more about Auxo itself, visit the `projects/Auxo` section of this website!

### My Background

I'm from Sierra Leone but was born in Guinea, Conakry. Thanks to my parents' work[^2], I've had the amazing priviledge of having lived in nearly a dozen countries, spanning four of the seven continents. 

Here's a map of where I've lived. To see my country hopping 👉🏿 [timeline](https://www.bellabah.com/pages/timeline/timeline.html)
