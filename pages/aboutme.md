Hey hey <span class="wave">👋🏿</span> My name is **Mohamadou Bella Bah**.  

I'm a junior (2021) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) pursuing my bachelors (SB) and masters (MEng) in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu). 

I'm an engineer by training, who thinks about energy, electric grids, multiagent-systems, and AI. Alot. As a system level thinker, I don't shy away from thinking about things **globally** 🌎.

### My Background

I'm from Sierra Leone but was born in Guinea, Conakry. Thanks to my parents' work[^2], I've had the amazing priviledge of having lived in nearly a dozen countries, spanning four of the seven continents. 

Here's a map of where I've lived. To see my life's timeline 👉🏿 [timeline](http://localhost:4000/pages/timeline/timeline.html)
