Hey hey üëãüèø My name is **Mohamadou Bella Bah**.  

I'm an engineer by training who thinks about energy, electric grids,
multiagent-systems, and artificial intelligence. **A lot**. As a system level
thinker, I don't shy away from thinking about things globally üåé.

## What I'm currently up to . . .
I'm currently researching with the [Active Adaptive Control
Laboratory](http://aaclab.mit.edu) (AACLAB) at MIT, with funding from the MIT
Energy Initiative (MITEI). My work with the lab is concerned with how to pair
independent agents together in a multiagent system. More specifically, in the
context of an electric grid, the idea is that privately owned solar-panels and
batteries ought to automatically pair with one another to form a more flexible
and less volatile, hybrid asset. I'm writing a service that imbues a
solar-panel, and a battery, with the necessary "intelligence" to engage one
another in such a relationship. Now, this would be difficult if I had to build
the communications infrastructure and underlying intelligence from the ground
up. Fortunately, this service can be run on the Auxo Olympus Platform, which is
an "edge-computing" platform that I developed.


You can take a look at my research poster in the `work/posters` section of this website. It goes into some detail regarding services running on the Auxo platform. To learn more about Auxo itself, visit `projects/Auxo`.

## My Background

I'm from Sierra Leone but was born in Guinea, Conakry. Thanks to my parents' work[^2], I've had the amazing privilege of living in nearly a dozen countries, spanning four of the seven continents. 

Here's a map of where I've lived. To see where I've lived as a cool, vertical timeline thingy, click here üëâüèø [timeline](https://www.bellabah.com/pages/timeline/timeline.html)
