I'd written this last summer for the Muslim Student Association here at MIT. I am by no means a financial expert, but I want to share with you all the things I've learned about saving for retirement in the United States of 'Murica. If I've made mistakes, let me know and I'll correct them -- I invite comments! Without any further ado, let's get into it!

## TLDR; 
Although retirement for the majority of us college kids is a long way off, I think it's worth familiarizing ourselves with the process. 

- Before thinking about investing for retirement, be sure to assess your financial situation first. For a lot of us, retirement is more than 20 years away, so meet your immediate needs first. Generally, when we say investing, we mean in the stock market. Now, remember, investing in the stock market and other securities is in no way guaranteed; in fact, investing and speculating can quite easily become synonymous ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, but you **do** want your gains from being right to outweigh the costs from being wrong. It's literally the definition of profit. 

- Open a Roth IRA with one of Vanguard, Charles Schwab or Fidelity[^1], because these accounts provide favorable tax treatment as opposed to a regular brokerage account. You can contribute up to $6,000 per year and you can withdraw your contributions anytime restriction- and penalty-free. 

- Great, now that you‚Äôve opened a Roth IRA, I suggest purchasing [ETFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) (exchange traded funds) so you have an exposure to markets and sectors as a whole as opposed to individual assets. 

- Keep on contributing to your account, avoid early withdrawals, take care of yourself and others, and most importantly, enjoy life ‚ù§Ô∏è

Alright, before investing in securities (tradable financial assets like bonds, stocks, etc.) markets, it‚Äôs worth assessing your financial situation. Some good considerations to make are the following ‚Äì in order of priority: 

1. Do you have a budget? And just as important, are there ways in which you can immediately reduce **recurring** expenses? Example: I realized my phone plan was too much, so I downgraded ‚Äì that cut my monthly phone bill in half! Point isn't to deprive yourself, but to honestly evaluate you (and your dependent's) needs.

2. Do you have a small emergency fund? I think it‚Äôs a good idea to have some 3 months or so of expenses in a checking or savings account. Some people may disagree regarding how much they need to in an emergency fund so it may be worth thinking about the lines of credit and/or family/friend help that you can expect in a time of personal emergency ‚Äì just make sure your assumptions are valid; i.e. if you are on the hook for an unforeseen security deposit which you otherwise don‚Äôt have the cash for, you can‚Äôt assume that your younger sibling can front you. The Pros and cons of having an emergency fund in a savings and checking account:  
   1. Savings
      1. **Pros**: You can get an interest rate varying between 2% and 2.5% nowadays using an online bank, i.e. Ally, Discover, etc. Up to $250,000 of your deposits is federally insured in the event of the bank‚Äôs failure. 
      2. **Cons**: There is a federal limit on how often you can withdraw your funds. This limit is 6 withdrawals per month without penalty; after that, you‚Äôre charged a fee. 
   2. Checkings
      1. **Pros**: You can easily access your money, as frequently as you like for the most part. The money is also federally insured in the event of the bank‚Äôs failure. 
      2. **Cons**: Lower interest yields, ranging from 0.01% to 0.37% at the time this was written. Because you generally access your checking account via a debit or atm card you're at greater risk for fraud; while the bank investigates, your money will not be available. Make sure you are aware of bank‚Äôs fraud protection policy and aim to avoid using a debit card in lieu of a credit card for day to day purchases.

3. What is the degree of your debts? It may be worth allocating some of your cash flow towards servicing the interest on the debts or paying down the debt principal altogether. If you have ‚Äúfavorable" student loans whose interest payments start only once you‚Äôve graduated, it makes a lot of sense to pay down as much as the principal as possible. I‚Äôm not American nor am I outwardly political, but please don‚Äôt bet on your student loans being forgiven in the next four or so years. That is, irrespective of what the forgive-college-student-debt, and the opposing camp say, maintain the course, but remain vigilant and flexible. 

Don‚Äôt take any of the above as hard requirements (except taxes and any usurious debt üòî). These really are just considerations, and you can pretty much do ‚Äòem all at the same time; especially if you have an income while you're in college; i.e. x% goes towards your emergency fund, y% goes toward paying down debts, and you ‚Äòunlock‚Äô z% after having reduced an expense. 

### Saving for Retirement 
Alrightio! once you feel comfortable saving for retirement and other large goals, opening a Roth IRA is an excellent option. (To be clear, you may never feel "ready", but 'tis life). Now, full disclaimer: investing in securities such as bonds, stocks and etc. are never without risk; there is always the chance that you will lose both your profits and the principal amount that you‚Äôd invested. Also, it‚Äôs worth noting that historical returns/profits are not fully indicative of future returns and profit. And finally, I, Mohamadou Bella Bah, am not responsible for your investment performance and/or financial situation, that includes the good (yay!), bad (aww) and the average (meh). As ever, be vigilant of your own financial situation and what it means in the context of the world around you. 


Phew, now that disclaimer‚Ñ¢ is out of the way, let‚Äôs talk Roth. A Roth IRA is an investment account that offers you favorable tax treatment. Every year, you may choose to put up to $6,000 into the account and invest in whatever securities you wish ‚Äì this is called a contribution. With a Roth IRA (there is another IRA, a Traditional IRA which I won‚Äôt get into here), any contribution you make has already been taxed at your current income tax rate. What this means, is that later, any earnings you make on your contributions will be tax free so long as you meet the age and/or eligibility requirements. Some of these requirements may include being 59 and ¬Ω years old, or that you intend to use your earnings towards paying for a home or education. 

#### How does this differ from investing in a regular brokerage account?

 Mostly it comes down to how you are taxed. When you buy $500 worth of stock in say Microsoft (stock ticker symbol MSFT) for example, the money you use to purchase said shares has been ‚Äúalready taxed‚Äù because of your income tax. While holding your stock in Microsoft, you‚Äôll receive perhaps $10 worth of dividends (regular payments made every 3 months to shareholders), which are also taxed. When you choose to sell your MSFT stock for a capital gain (i.e. your shares are now worth $900), you‚Äôll be charged again. So, in a (contrived) way, there a three taxable events: purchasing the stock, receiving dividends from the stock, and later selling the stock for a gain. (Not to mention, that you may have to pay your broker a transaction fee to both purchase and sell the stock.) Within a Roth IRA, you won‚Äôt pay any taxes on the latter two events so long as you meet the eligibility requirements. 

 I‚Äôd say there are three good financial institutions to open a Roth IRA with, these are Vanguard, Charles Schwab (what I use), and Fidelity[^1]. I highly recommend Charles Schwab, but you can‚Äôt really go wrong with any of the three. Each offers you plenty of inexpensive ETFs (these are funds that hold stock in many different assets and companies as a means of diversification. Investing in individual stocks as a capital limited investor can be risky ‚Äì or so goes the general wisdom). Whichever institution you pick, I recommend purchasing the ETFs that they offer to avoid any transaction fees, i.e. if you want to own stock in the broad US equities market, purchase VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) if using Vanguard, or SCHB (Schwab Strategic US Broad Market ETF) if using Charles Schwab. What people usually suggest is setting up a three-fund portfolio ‚Äì this means within your Roth IRA, you allocate x% to US Stocks, y% to international and emerging market stocks, and z% to bonds. I did something a little bit different. 
 
#### Bella, what does your ROTH IRA look like? 
 My Roth IRA looks like the following in order from smallest to largest in terms of allocation in my portfolio: 

- SCHE (Schwab Emerging Markets) 
- SCHF (Schwab International Equities) 
- SCHD (Schwab US Dividend Equities) 
- SCHX (Schwab US Large Cap ETF) ~ 60%

Note that this is not necessarily my desired allocation (read disclaimer‚Ñ¢). Also note that you don‚Äôt have to purchase ETFs, you can purchase individual stocks, individual bonds and etc. as you‚Äôd like. I don‚Äôt claim to be an investment expert, so it may be worth looking into what makes the most sense for you. Generally, I strive to add $x to my account every 6 months or so (I lean more towards investing with lump-sum dollars, rather than dollar-cost averaging. See [this](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum) Vanguard article discussing the two). 

## Where to Next Captain? 
Going forward, I‚Äôd suggest reading the sidebars in the personal finance subreddit [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/), and following and sticking to a [three fund portfolio](https://bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). 

That‚Äôs pretty much all I have to say on the topic for now. I love investing, finance and such things, so let me know if there's anything you want to discuss!
