Two lovers
    
Apart
    
Separated by large and empty desert expanse
    
On which the wind gently rocks tumbleweeds to and fro

So tangled so as to never unravel

Between—
    
Two lovers gazing longingly at the other,
    
Having taken cue from nature
    
*How I wish we’d tumble into tight embrace*
