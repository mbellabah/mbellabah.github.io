Heaven determined that the cosmos be like a frozen sea,

And were its mandate met, 

All would be commanded still in icy thrall,

Oâ€™ mankind!

Take inspiration from the defiant stars,

Those selfless stars,

Who generously share their stolen warmth,

Burning as it were with a Promethean soul,

To light for us a way.
