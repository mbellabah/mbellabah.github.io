There is a certain arrogance in man,

That has him believe,

That despite it all, he will make it happen,

But like a deluge wherefor man fixes a dam in prevention,

God humbles him,

For God intended that man prostrate and not command the universe,

But there are times,

When the will of man is so concentrated and thus made potent,

And his soul cries so loud,

That God, while he need not, observes the covenant that exchanges His favor for manâ€™s unbridled passion

So that all that which need not happen, is rewritten to be.
