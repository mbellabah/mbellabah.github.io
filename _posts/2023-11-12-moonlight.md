How perfect you looked beneath the moonlight,

So I bought the moon and named it after you,

Wove the stars into our own constellation,

And wrapped your tapestry in the velvety black of night,

And in our marble pavilion, gathered fairies to play our song on moonflower trumpets,

But, it was a gift you were surprised to receive.

Darling, why must you hurt me so?
