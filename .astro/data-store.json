This great house was an old house, by and large considered one of the \"better\" houses. Nevertheless, like all material things, it was not without its blemishes: in some of its support beams were termites; in some of its closets, lingered ghosts; in a few of its cellars, rats; and several of its many bathrooms cultivated mold in sinks and tubs worse than a petri dish. As such, we can uncontroversially say that it was a *great* but *imperfect* house.\n\nThe resident of this house had inherited it-like most others-and he generally saw to it that it was somewhat kept, but was loath to ever do too much, or at least, any more than that immediately required. For all intents and purposes, it was *his* house, but he didn’t feel that way—he’d added nothing to the original structure, he hadn’t arranged for new rooms or new designs, he hadn’t done anything quite so avant-garde or altogether impressive. In his view, all of his work was incremental and it meant a paralyzing indifference came easily to him. As a rather shortsighted man (he wore glasses for his condition), he viewed life through the narrow lens of days, not years, and so influenced were his perceptions of progress. This isn’t to say that he believed all he did to be totally useless; to him, it was simply that the home took much of the benefits of his labor and left little for him.\n\nFurther, he suspected, given that he’d inherited this great house, that some of his neighbors secretly thought him spoiled. Saddled further with the wariness that the house’s history and size dwarfed him; he was always known as “that fellow that lives in that home” rather than “that fellow that owns that home”. You could say that the house owned him more than he did it.\n\nOne day, when his general dissatisfaction was too much to bear, he slammed one of the home’s many doors in frustration. Having been abruptly shut, the door shuddered and the hinges rattled and the doorknob slowly fell off, its particular slowness comical in comparison to the broader suddenness. Had he any wider perspective, he would’ve found this a mild inconvenience, if somewhat funny, and more importantly, trivially repaired. But alas, for this apathetic man, this pushed him over the edge: “surely other homes don’t have doorknobs that fall off”, “surely other homes are made of a sturdier and better stuff” he thought to himself. It is often called a fallacy, but in this line of thinking, this man was indeed tumbling down a rather slippery slope, as sloped as the hill upon which this great house sat. He began to hate his home. And not with that burning visible hate, at least not just yet. For now, it was that hidden, contemptuous hate, a hate where upon seeing something broken you don’t bother to fix it because your mind says it’s just as good broken as it is fixed.\n\nAfter this event, which we should be clear, was accompanied in quick succession by several other disappointments of varying consequence, the resident flipped completely. He began to *actively* pick apart his home. To the glee or pity of onlookers—some of his few envious or fewer reasonable neighbors—he would destroy the banisters, he would peel the paint, he would determined to forgo any and all necessary repairs, he would dent the gutters and shatter windows with rocks he’d throw, he’d deride his home to anyone that’d listen. As was mentioned, some things he did to “show off”, for there was a certain energy from the gathering crowd that he fed off of. In doing all this, he at least felt more than his home. Through destructive action after destructive action, he grew steadily superior and his home steadily inferior (relatively speaking)—his labor no longer appeared incremental but extraordinary…revolutionary even. Some things he justified as careful measures against the termites or the rats, and in his defense, it is true that as he pillaged the cellars, attics, and closets, the rats and their cousins dispersed.\n\nHe would tear down and tear down and tear down his home until he became himself worse than any termite infestation. Finally to an end, the home was in near total disrepair, and his scorn and disdain for the home was now easily apparent. He’d sucked dry from the home (and himself) any ounce of pride or gratitude for what he possessed and this vacum was made manifest. He continued to labor to a disastrously low minimum, only that which was strictly necessary to guarantee himself a cot to lay at night. As seeing, however, that he was the most energetic and impassioned he’d ever been, it goes without saying that he didn’t need sleep very much and thus less diligent about even this mild upkeep.\n\nThe slope was slippery, but the slope has a bottom, and he was at rock bottom, or very near it. It all came to a head when one night things were taken too far. As an evolution of the orgiastic disassemblies of his home, he’d started a bonfire in the front yard with pieces of his home and invited whoever wanted to attend, the fence gate was left open. As an audience, they would together take pieces, all of which incidentally turned out to be inconsequential (otherwise the house would’ve toppled over then and there) and hurl them into the fire. The passions of man are like a fire—it can spread like fire, it is immaterial like fire, it can be directed towards destruction or production like fire, it can be snuffed when starved of its fuel or incentive like fire, it is unpredictable and fickle in the presence of changing moods, winds and trends, and like fire, easily agitated and overwhelmingly greedy.\n\nIt was a breezy night, and so the wind coaxed the fire and it grew and grew. All weren't ignorant to the inherent danger the burning of the effigy posed, but in this danger was a beauty in the way the flames danced and twirled; it embodied so well the bright and hotly burning zeal that had totally seized the crowd. So thorough was the hypnosis that there was no objection from any of the onlookers and certainly none from the participants.\n\nLest we forget that fire is fickle and winds ever-changing, a sudden strong gust of wind took the flame and pressed it like a big thumb against the whole house. It was not too long until the entire building was ablaze and gradually devoured by the greedy fire. His neighbors all ran to their homes, none were firefighters. At this moment, all anyone cared about was their own home and that the wind not carry those greedy, lice-like embers towards it. Atop this great hill burned this great house, now a lighthouse akin to the sort that warn of the impending rock faces that shred mighty ships.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a blistering cold night, the warmth from the burning of his home was a good and pleasurable feeling. A warmth that came at great cost, the despoiling of his own inheritance. Doubly tragic because that same home had a fireplace, plenty of firewood, and a functional chimney. Even this man, as shortsighted as he was, flames flickering in the lens of his glasses, could see that the building, as great as it was, could only continue burning for so much longer. Soon the last ember would die out, and he’d be left by himself. Alone and shivering in the cold.","src/content/posts/an-ashen-inheritance.mdx","1db818927b1c1e42","an-ashen-inheritance.mdx","cresting-sisyphus-mountain",{"id":106,"data":108,"body":112,"filePath":113,"digest":114,"legacyId":115,"deferredRender":22},{"title":109,"date":110,"tags":111},"Cresting Sisyphus’ Mountain",["Date","2023-08-25T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"Readily will I unburden Sisyphus,\n\nWithout care to crest the Mountain in which Man finds banal suffering and his very Soul trapped,\n\nI shall relieve Sisyphus of that accursed boulder.\n\nSo readily will I heft said sorry stone above my head\n\nAnd to Atlas' awe,\n\nStrike down hard\n\nTo split asunder the very Mountain\n\nIn which Hope, and her twin, Ambition, were imprisoned\n\nAnd with that same weighty stone,\n\nBy which a mighty prison has been made rubble\n\nSpurred on by Hope and Ambition's maddening cheer and,\n\nA promise to irrevocably free Man's soul\n\nBowl it hard into those dominos ringed as final cage\n\nThat were erected high and tall; intended to obscure and muddle mine clarity of purpose,\n\nSo that what was thought indomitable,\n\nAll topple over in a rushing cascade—\n\nYielding.\n\nThe cosmic gameboard flattened—\n\nBy the efforts of a man\n\n*Mine.*","src/content/posts/cresting-sisyphus-mountain.mdx","442cf69c4a1f55e1","cresting-sisyphus-mountain.mdx","dignity",{"id":116,"data":118,"body":124,"filePath":125,"digest":126,"legacyId":127,"deferredRender":22},{"title":119,"date":120,"tags":121},"Musings on Dignity",["Date","2020-03-23T00:00:00.000Z"],[122,123],"philosophy","essay","**Author's note:** This article is inspired by one of the themes explored in Martin Luther King, Jr’s [“Remaining Awake through a Great Revolution”](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/remaining-awake-through-great-revolution) speech. As a result, riddled throughout this article are some of my favorite quotes from said speech. I’d started this piece on MLK day but never found the time to look at it, much less finish it. Until now! During this long COVID-19 quarantine, I have plenty of time to think and write. \n\n---\n---\n\n## Introduction \n> We must all learn to live together as brothers, or we will all perish together as fools. We are tied together in the single garment of destiny, caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. And whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. -- **Martin Luther King, Jr.** \n\nGenerally, in keeping with my policy of maintaining a [small identity](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html), I avoid being publicly political or philosophical. But every now and then, musings and meditations of mine will get through. As my father says, “like it or not, *everything* is political”. Also, there are some topics for which you must have an opinion, for example \"slavery is bad\". \n\nThis article is on **human dignity** and I’ve got two hopes, that: (1) I may convince you of the moral imperative to uphold the dignity of all people, everywhere, and (2) assuming I’ve succeeded at the former, that we commit henceforth to being these noble stewards of human dignity. \n\n## What is Dignity?  \n\n> How can one avoid being depressed when he sees with his own eyes evidences of millions of people going to bed hungry at night? How can one avoid being depressed when he sees with his own eyes God’s children sleeping on the sidewalks at night? In Bombay more than a million people sleep on the sidewalks every night. In Calcutta more than six hundred thousand sleep on the sidewalks every night. They have no beds to sleep in; they have no houses to go in. How can one avoid being depressed when he discovers that out of India’s population of more than five hundred million people, some four hundred and eighty million make an annual income of less than ninety dollars a year? And most of them have never seen a doctor or a dentist. -- **Martin Luther King, Jr.**\n\nOxford dictionary’s definition is a good starting point.\n\n> Dignity: the state or quality of being worthy of honor or respect -- **Oxford English Dictionary**\n\nBut the definition's use of “worthy” implies a responsibility that is one-way when it comes to the phrase \"they treated her with dignity\" – the object [her] must *do* something to be deserving of the subject's [they] respectful treatment. I like my friend's definition a bit better: \"dignity is the right to chase [and demand] one's own humanization\" (insertion mine). I suspect however, just like how we’d point at the sky to describe the color blue, defining dignity is better served by providing examples of where it is and where it is not observed. \n\nWe can do the latter easily; there comes to mind many cases where dignity is abused or eroded: \n- A child who goes to bed hungry for lack of food is without their dignity. \n- A mother and son drafted or compelled to aid a war that neither of whom agree with are both deprived of their dignity. \n- To dehumanize another on the basis of race, privately held religious beliefs, sex, age, or origin is to treat them without dignity. \n\nThere is no definitive closed-form definition for dignity. Rather, in practice, there are the many unique and individual approximations for it that overlap just well enough that we may go about our day-to-day cordially. Disagreement is more common in courts of law and wherever fancy philosophers congregate. As William Binchy, a famous Irish lawyer, puts it: \"[dignity’s] meaning depends greatly on the philosophical premises of those who invoke it; the range of such premises is so broad that ‘dignity’ can have completely opposing connotations”. We’ll deal with this fuzziness in definition just as we've come to mutual agreement regarding what constitutes 'red' or 'anger' notwithstanding our fundamental differences in vision and feeling. We march on, taking a cue from the engineer's customary response to the mathematician's protest that pi should not be rounded to 3.0: \"it’s good enough!\" \n\nFrom the previous discussion, we know that a person’s dignity is made up of a few parts. These are: \n- Self. This describes the person’s mental state. Human beings are endowed with a consciousness that is self-aware and capable of differentiating between the individual and others. It also includes the faculties that directly impact others and the environment. For example, one can use their hands to erect for themselves a shelter or to hit someone else. \n- Others. Like the definition above for self, but not belonging to the person in question, but to “others”. \n- Physical environment. Everything else. This includes the material conditions and context of the times in which a person's life is situated. \n\nThe natural question is then, where does dignity come from? \n\n## Where does Dignity come from? \n\n> No man is an island entire of itself. Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.\" And he goes on toward the end to say, \"Any man’s death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind; therefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\" We must see this, believe this, and live by it if we are to remain awake through a great revolution. -- **Martin Luther King, Jr.**\n\nWith no evidence beyond my own anecdotal experiences and observations, I assert that everybody belongs to either one of two camps, “Camp Innate” (Camp-I) or “Camp Relative” (Camp-R), when it comes to dignity's origin. Camp-I believes that dignity is innate to all man, that so long as man exists there is dignity, in much the same way that the act of \"being\" drags along with it (dis)order. The other camp, Camp-R, believes dignity to be a purely relative thing, and as such, only ever meaningfully exists in multi-person settings, i.e. society, just as how tallness is only relevant if there are other things against which one can compare themselves. Since I think both are right, I’m going to cheat and say I straddle both camps. Let me give my reasoning by way of an illustration. \n\nSuppose there is some regular ol’ gentleman-hermit, Adam, who in all his life, has never interacted with another sentient living thing – a terrifyingly lonely existence[^1]. Since there's nobody to keep Adam company[^2], those belonging to the Camp-R would argue that Adam has no conception of dignity. I agree, but only partially. Because Adam is a human being for whom time is an absolute, perceptible and unidirectional construct[^3], at any instance, Adam has some memory of his past self a number of days ago and the material conditions in which this “past self” lived. Likewise, Adam also has a “future self” that can be extrapolated from his past and present selves together. Voila! Here are the \"others\" that Adam needs along with his \"self\" and physical environment to ascertain whether his present self is living in comparative dignity or squalor. In this crude sense, both camps are correct. This to me affirms an additional intrinsic link between dignity, progress and the chasing of one's own humanization. \n\nThe sharp-eyed reader might have the following misgiving: that because Adam’s past and future selves are incapable of directly impacting present Adam’s perceptions, that Camp-I and Camp-R are not one and the same. This is true but not invalidating; in fact, we can construct the contrived case where Adam constructs a robot, programs it with instructions to randomly interfere with his environment, then permits the robot to run amok and terrorize his future self. Adam would then destroy any evidence of his creating the robot and then deliberately bonk himself on the head so that he forgets ever creating it. In this way, it's apparent that Adam’s past self can have some material and lasting impact upon his present and future, but I digress. Let’s bail out on Adam. I’m already getting a headache! \n\nIt’s fair to say that dignity and freedom aren't clearly defined, and yet, we are capable of recognizing when others are treated with dignity and we can, usually by testing boundaries, establish the degree of our personal autonomy. Whether these abilities are innate, a natural result of human evolution and thus reproducible in other species, or whether this was bequeathed to us, like the concept of democracy, by some enlightened fellow(s) many years ago, isn’t particularly relevant here. Because no matter the driving force, the end result is the same: it is quite simply by virtue of being human, that we deserve enduring dignified treatment – if not as a right, like my friend suggests, then as a moral principle. \n\n#### Brief Interlude. Rights vs. Principles\nIn my view, a principle is an overarching, self-contained and general category. A norm becomes a principle if it is widely applied and universally accepted across scenarios and maintains similar broad applicability at the different scales, i.e. the family unit vs. the state – *honesty is the best policy*. Rights are derived from these principles as a *proxy* but may sometimes be in conflict – generally, rights concern the individual and may be temporarily overridden to reconcile the tension that undergirds interactions between an individual and society (individual welfare vs. societal welfare). Ideally, all rights and the principles that they are derived from are observed at all times, but realistically, rights are those requirements society, a collection of individuals, optimize for and accord different weightings. \n\n## Does Everybody have Dignity? \nI can anticipate the unease of some readers, are murderers deserving of dignified treatment? Ultimately, human beings are self-directed, and as such, singly responsible for the success and failure of his or her own moral enterprise – this is true even if some of the blame can be deflected to external factors like abuse, circumstance or neglect. The only time which I reject **fully** this notion of individualistic personal responsibility is in cases of severely [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality) such as coercion at gunpoint. \n\nIn the case of a murderer, their crime has almost by definition violated the dignity of another human being. If dignity is not something to be accorded to all human beings then what crime has the murderer committed? For subjectively speaking, there are those that will say no crime has been committed, e.g. a soldier killing an enemy combatant. Conversely, if dignity belongs to all people, then must society continue to give the murderer the same dignified treatment they enjoyed before their wicked act? Wouldn’t doing otherwise be antithetical to the notion that human rights are derived from human dignity? Here lies the conundrum that concerns punishment, treatment, criminality and dignity. \n\nAccording to Plato’s Laws, a punishment should cause a criminal to emerge “a better man, or failing this, less of a wretch”. Those in favor of capital punishment will be quick to point out that a dead criminal is indeed less of a wretch, but that's probably not what Plato meant. I personally believe that even those responsible for the most heinous of crimes ought to still have their dignity respected. I’m not a judge, a rehabilitation expert, nor am I well versed in law, so I haven’t a clue as to what is the appropriate punishment for a given crime[^4]; that is, with respect to what is good for the victim(s), society and the criminal. What I will say however, is that care must be taken so that a punishment does not excessively damage or extinguish the hope for change – this is true whether that hope for change is within the criminal themself or the victim(s) and society at large. As such, this necessarily precludes the death penalty as a “reasonable” punishment. What to do instead? Until we discover a method to rehabilitate (read: reprogram) a criminal's mind in such a way that everyone deems ethical and acceptable, we can only continue what it is we currently do, locking people up indefinitely. \n\nAs an answer, it’s not very satisfying, but I fear it’s one of those things that we’ll continue to wrestle with. You’d think that some clever bloke would have an answer, and would have created a religion around it. Even religions with their talk of afterlife don’t have any punishment that is final; bad people go to hell, and even there, God himself does not utterly smite sinners from existence. \n\n## Why should You be a Steward of Dignity? \n> Somewhere we must come to see that human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals who are willing to be co-workers with God. And without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation. So, we must help time and realize that the time is always ripe to do right.\n\nMuch of international law and its charters are all predicated on the notion that all the rights we enjoy as humans flow from our dignity as humans. Just as we struggle against the disorder that the universe would like to force upon us, we also struggle against dehumanization and the rejection of human dignity with the knowledge that it comes sometimes at the hands of our own people. \n\nWe must recognize that progress is reversible and that dignity is something that can be violated. Just as we can step forward, we can take steps back and stumble back down to whence we came. Our journey is set on a mountain, with its long climb ahead to reach a lofty peak that we know exists but can't fully make out through the clouds. \n\n>And I started thinking of the fact that we spend in America millions of dollars a day to store surplus food, and I said to myself, \"I know where we can store that food free of charge—in the wrinkled stomachs of millions of God’s children all over the world who go to bed hungry at night.\" And maybe we spend far too much of our national budget establishing military bases around the world rather than bases of genuine concern and understanding. -- **Martin Luther King, Jr.**\n\nYou're probably wondering how the hell any of this applies to you. On paper, it seems like it's too much. Perhaps, you say, dignity is just rhetorical flourish, something that humanitarians say to convince themselves that what it is they do has meaning, or that philosophers and those on the periphery bandy around to sound smart and enlightened. \n\nBut let us recount the lessons.\n\nWhether we belong to Camp-I or Camp-R, we know that dignity isn't contextual, it's not an inside joke. We know that dignity belongs to all and is based in our own perceptions, our interactions with others and our particular circumstances. What ties man to woman to child to person is the right to chase their own humanization and to demand it from others – we are not playing solitaire. We know that the things that human dignity has afforded us are not permanent fixtures; although dignity isn't a belief, there are those seeking to undermine it so that they may dehumanize and oppress their fellow man, just as there are those that will lie and bend the facts to get their way. \n\nMartin Luther King bears repeating: \n> We must all learn to live together as brothers, or we will all perish together as fools. We are tied together in the single garment of destiny, caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. And whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. -- **Martin Luther King, Jr.** \n\nLet us all strive to be noble stewards of dignity. \n\n---\n\n### Labels, Labels and more Labels\nSome of you might after reading this say to yourself, \"Why, Bella's a [*insert label here*] and that's good/bad for so and so reasons . . .\"\n\nLet me be clear, I don't want to be identified by any label whatsoever, e.g. libertarian, socialist, republican, democrat or etc.. It's a legitimate fear of mine that how I describe myself today will be perverted to mean something else tomorrow. To those that I've disappointed now wagging their finger in disgust “Bella, you’re a coward!” I say, I’m not a coward, I’m just prudent. In these days of much learning and unlearning and shifting connotations and word reclaiming and the bastardization and perversions of words, I do not want to be misinterpreted simply because I failed to revise my opinion using the correct labels of the time. Simply, I don’t trust language anymore, it’s not as enduring as it once was[^5]. Define me by what I say, write and do; that is surer to be **me** than the charter of some tribe that I am unwittingly a member of. \n\n**Thanks** to Mauricio Fortuna (the aforementioned friend) for reading a draft of this and providing much appreciated and insightful commentary. \n\n\n[^1]: If you guessed that our Adam is inspired by the same Adam in the Abrahamic religions, you’d be correct. Adam just has to “be” because no human is born in isolation without tacit permission of another human being. \n[^2]: Speaking of others, go read my poem on a man talking with his [“other”](/2020-01-21-talk-with-other).\n[^3]: Interestingly, there is no such thing as “absolute time”. When moving at relativistic speeds, it apparently becomes nonsensical to discuss time in the normal way. You have Einstein and his theory of relativity to thank for this “strange idea”. \n[^4]: This is not an endorsement of the present incarceration system and its experts. Although I think there are good-intentioned experts and stakeholders acting in good faith everywhere, I cannot deny that dehumanization and oppression runs rampant today. \n[^5]: To really beat this dead horse deader, it’s like a man pre-World War 2, who after an amazing trip to India, erects a large swastika in his front yard, then goes on a 10-year sabbatical with no access to the outside world. Imagine his shock when he learns that the symbol he’d erected as a monument of his appreciation of Indian religions now constitutes a hate symbol. Naturally, his neighbors despise him and suspect him of being a Nazi, even though he isn’t. An exaggeration, I know, but it gets the point across that you have to be vigilant that the labels you assign yourself aren’t co-opted to mean something you don’t intend later.","src/content/posts/dignity.mdx","f207ee7b50043523","dignity.mdx","enlightenment-now",{"id":128,"data":130,"body":136,"filePath":137,"digest":138,"legacyId":139,"deferredRender":22},{"title":131,"date":132,"tags":133},"Thoughts on \"The Enlightenment Now\"",["Date","2020-01-21T00:00:00.000Z"],[134,135],"reading","social philosophy","Here are my thoughts on Steven Pinker's *The Enlightenment Now*.

Remember your history: the fact that something is bad today doesn't mean it was better in the past. Remember your philosophy: one cannot reason that there's no such thing as reason, or that something is true or good because God said it is. And remember your psychology: much of what we know isn't so, especially when our comrades know it too.\n> \n> Keep some perspective. Not every problem is a Crisis, Plague, Epidemic, or Existential Threat, and not every change is the End of This, the Death of That, or the Dawn of a Post-Something Era. Don't confuse pessimism with profundity: problems are inevitable, but problems are solvable, and diagnosing every setback as a symptom of a sick society is a cheap grab for gravitas. Finally, drop the Nietzsche. His ideas may seem edgy, authentic, bad, while humanism seems sappy, unhip, uncool But what's so funny about peace, love, and understanding? -- **Steven Pinker** \n\n#### On democracy\n> Democracy’s strength stems from the freedom to complain. -- **Steven Pinker**\n\n> Democracy, he suggests, is essentially based on giving people the freedom to complain: “It comes about when the people effectively agree not to use violence to replace the leadership, and the leadership leaves them free to try to dislodge it by any other means. -- **Steven Pinker**\n\n#### On the availability heuristic[^1] and availability cascade[^2]\n>The political scientist Kathryn Sikkink calls this the information paradox: as human rights watchdogs admirably look harder for abuse, look in more places for abuse, and classify more acts as abuse, they find more of it -- but if we don’t compensate for their keener powers of detection, we can be misled into thinking that there is more abuse to detect. -- **Steven Pinker**\n\n---\n\n[^1]: The availability heuristic is a cognitive bias where we overestimate the likelihood of certain events that have greater \"availability\" in our minds. \n[^2]: Repeat something long enough and it will become \"true\".","src/content/posts/enlightenment-now.mdx","6fc37225a29c660f","enlightenment-now.mdx","endurance-of-spirit",{"id":140,"data":142,"body":146,"filePath":147,"digest":148,"legacyId":149,"deferredRender":22},{"title":143,"date":144,"tags":145},"Endurance of Spirit",["Date","2023-10-22T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"Man is first pliable,\n\nOnly when compelled to run through nature’s course,\n\nThrough her crags and bramble, and under an angry sun and an inhospitable cold,\n\nIs he made firm, sharp, and with purpose,\n\nJust as the sword gains its shape under hammer blows,\n\nFinds its edge in the whetstone,\n\nAnd its bite when put to task.","src/content/posts/endurance-of-spirit.mdx","c4ee875b305327a4","endurance-of-spirit.mdx","feature-development",{"id":150,"data":152,"body":157,"filePath":158,"digest":159,"legacyId":160,"deferredRender":22},{"title":153,"date":154,"tags":155},"Weighing Innovation and Value in Feature Development",["Date","2024-07-15T00:00:00.000Z"],[123,156],"business","**Author's note**: The following is inspired by an entry in my journal reflecting on recent events at the office. After three and a half years of professional experience, I finally feel entitled to some opinions on how things ought to be done. Previously, holding such opinions would have been premature, even arrogant, and certainly unhelpful. I am fortunate to work in an environment that provides valuable lessons for my future not-as-of-yet-existing business, both in what to emulate and what to avoid.\n\n## Introduction: Swordfish\n\nSuppose we’re the operators of a SaaS (Software as a Service) business, “Swordfish”, deliberating on whether we ought to introduce a new feature called “Bebop” to our flagship product “Cowboy”. As operators, we look in the mirror every morning and recite our job description (thrice, lest we forget), which is: to effectively allocate Swordfish’s resources in pursuit of sustainable profit through which we create durable yet divisible long-term value, i.e. make it redeemable to the stakeholders over the established durations. Having donned our value-maximization hats, we put on whatever else we’d like and head for the office.\n\nWhen considering Bebop, we know in our bones that we must distinguish between “superficial innovation” and “productive innovation”; the choice of modifier depending on the balance of an innovation’s costs against its gains. To classify Bebop, we can enumerate the costs and finally consider under what conditions its gains trump said costs.\n\n## Evaluating Costs\n\nThe introduction of any feature is riddled with cost: There’s the obvious upfront cost in building it, e.g. wages, capital, and land expenses. Similarly obvious are the regular costs of its maintenance and support, included here too is the depreciation of extant capital. A feature needs usage and so Bebop’s successful adoption may require we assume further costs in marketing and user education. We must also consider the opportunity cost in the alternative projects forgone (the counterfactual nature of this cost means the exact accounting of it is often unclear but nonetheless nonzero). Arguably the least obvious but perhaps most long-term disastrous are those intangible and uncertain costs: brand dilution, a divergence or loss in internal focus, unforeseen disruption in Swordfish’s ability to execute elsewhere, as well as the risk that Bebop alienates core engaged users (our profitable cheerleaders and champions). That these are potentially long-term disastrous shouldn’t need further elaboration.\n\nHaving read somewhere that incentives are everything, we must also evaluate the incentive structure behind Bebop’s proposal. We’re well aware of how a certain competitor, “Big Number Co.”, has been criticized by those in the know for its “promo-driven development” where personal advancement comes before product coherence, leading to silly things like: discontinuing services just a year or two after their launch, breaking user experiences without adequate alternatives, nonsensical pricing or offer bundling, needless changes to logos and icons, reckless overstaffing and its subsequent layoffs. Besides not wanting to be silly, clever operators like ourselves should ask “what can we do?” A couple of things potentially: (1) Separate compensation from promotions; that is, reward performance with sizable and frequent bonuses and rely on the established mechanism of market stock growth (for public companies) for compensation beyond the base. If you want to be less reliant on the whims of Wall Street, consider internally publishing guidance and evaluating on a quarterly basis where the business compares against transparent and sensibly informed expectations — give out further discretionary rewards accordingly. (2) Inculcate a culture where the user is the focus, the customer the focus, the product the focus, and human-machine excellence is the focus. Make “busy work” something discouraged and taboo, one shouldn’t *feel* productive but rather *be* productive and so must all things have an end-goal. (3) To achieve the former, we have to be more forthright and open about growth and planning, that means proactively communicating any ceilings while working diligently to raise these ceilings and align company-wide efforts, and doing so from the get-go, i.e. by finding more opportunities for real growth at the company level. (Emphasis on company level, which is needed because bottom-up product planning inevitably results in those aforementioned silly things, top-down directives that prioritize consistency and business/product narrative are the way to go).\n\n## Conditions that Justify the Cost\n\nOk, suppose we’ve gone through the above exercise for Bebop. If we stop here we’d be demoralized, freeze Cowboy in maintenance mode and do nothing else besides that needed to counteract entropy. That’d be the wrong thing to do. To fulfill our fiduciary duty and achieve real growth through productive investment and innovation, of which Bebop could be an example, we must consider the conditions that might justify it.\n\n### 1. In Response to User Demands\n\nDirect requests can drive improvements that enhance user satisfaction and eventually improve the bottom line. However, the finesse lies in distinguishing between what users say they want and what they are willing to pay for or use. The noise-to-signal ratio from soliciting users is also apt to be poor: their requests can be too vague, too expensive, or downright irrelevant. As operators, we may hold two conflicting mental models in mind: (1) the user is king, always right, and worth listening to, and (2) the user is an idiot who must be guided to an understanding of their own desires.\n\n### 2. In Anticipation of Future Needs\n\nAs I imagine is often the case, users generally don’t actually know what they want and no amount of market surveys or group user studies will entirely lift that fog. Rather, we must believe that they’ll instinctively know what they want when they see it; and further, that we can meet these latent desires by observing them as they are, not as they claim. If we then have strong reason to both believe that they’ll want Bebop in the near future and that (1) will eventually apply, then Bebop may be worth the effort. The strong reasons here could be trends, regulation or macroeconomic changes, etc. With the (at times seemingly unethical) powers of marketing, we can alternatively substitute “strong reasons” with “a strong confidence in our ability to later convince them they want Bebop”, i.e. shape new behaviors and desires.\n\n### 3. Ecosystem and Brand Integration\n\nIf Cowboy belongs to an ecosystem that includes HammerHead and Jet, then feature additions like Bebop might be more about fortifying or consolidating the broader ecosystem rather than immediate revenue. It’s important to emphasize that in this case we expect an increase in overall market appeal to (indirectly) positively influence profitability down the line, notably in the holistic, final accounting instead of within individual product units. Cowboy improved by Bebop might then be called “loss-leading” for HammerHead and Jet collectively. \n\nAs I’ve only subtly alluded to, accounting structure and clarity of communication matters here. Consider a setup where the “loss-leading” Cowboy product is established as its own business unit responsible for its own PNL (Profit and Loss), but still expected to function as a loss-leader in the broader ecosystem (which is to the detriment of its PNL). The misalignment of incentives means the Cowboy unit is pulled in opposite directions as the leadership and employees at the various stages of product operations move in disconcert. As inconsistencies compound, the collapse of product coherence comes suddenly and violently, spoiling user trust in the broader ecosystem with it.\n\n### 4. As a Strategic Imperative or the Result of Competitor Dynamics \n\nAs Swordfish, we appreciate that staying competitive demands strategic agility. And so sometimes, whether to develop Bebop comes down to strategic imperative: we either need to develop a competency in some area since it transfers well to other projects that we’re certain will grow the bottom line, or we must safeguard against obsolescence by matching market standards, i.e. quickly achieve at minimum a parity with competitors.\n\nWe have to be careful here however, on the one hand, we don’t want to be reacting to competitors as we’re ideally accountable only to our customers and users. An obsession with competitors can mean dropping ourselves to their level and, God forbid, introducing anti-patterns which we justify by pointing to their being precedence for it. That said, there is such a thing as being left behind, and so you might have to suck it up and build, even if what you’re building purportedly does nothing good for anyone, except perhaps for a couple consumers who temporarily enjoy a larger than normal consumer surplus. (This is how the “stuff AI into everything” of the current moment feels and how Cryptocurrency felt two years ago). Consider two similarly priced products, Cowboy and the competing Syndicate, both of which identically meet user requirements and are equally pleasant to use. Syndicate however has some additional irrelevant feature, “Useless Bebop”, that Cowboy does not. Ceteris paribus, Syndicate will see more usage than Cowboy simply by virtue of the fact that Syndicate seemingly provides more. Unless of course, both products belong to a particular class of products where more is in fact bad, something we conveniently avoid and can ignore given our assumption that the additional feature “Useless Bebop” is irrelevant and useless.\n\n## A Final Thought\n\nIn the end, if we’re to be responsible operators, the decision to introduce Bebop shouldn’t be taken lightly. It requires a thorough understanding of its potential impact, a careful consideration of costs and benefits, and a deep alignment with long-term strategy and cultural values. Once again, we might *feel* productive, but let’s ensure we actually *be* productive by innovating productively.","src/content/posts/feature-development.mdx","db03238544a3fbb6","feature-development.mdx","haikus-at-3am",{"id":161,"data":163,"body":167,"filePath":168,"digest":169,"legacyId":170,"deferredRender":22},{"title":164,"date":165,"tags":166},"Haiku at 3am",["Date","2023-09-10T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"**Author's note:** Driving back from a party late at night and my slight astigmatism causing the other vehicle's lights to seem like halos, my mind went straight to stars, their beauty, and the kernel of the idea that the terrestrial mirrors the heavens, but does so imperfectly; an example being man’s many, many city lights which must seem like a lame imitation of stars from above[^1].

The setup is pictured below: two circles (of radius $r$) are inscribed within a $2r \\times r$ rectangle. I've chosen, without loss of generality, $r = 1$.\n\nThe goal is to find the total area of the shaded region, which is the curved, sloping triangle to either side of the circles. This can be considered to be the complement of the union in area of the two circles (within the *universe* of the $2r \\times r$ rectangle).\n\n![](../../assets/posts/inscribed_circles/initial-problem.png)\n\n\nThere are two approaches to this problem: (1) numerical integration, and (2) geometric decomposition. I'll set out to show each, starting first with the numerical integration.\n\n## Numerical Integration\n\nIf we take ourselves back to grade school, we know that we can compute the area of a shape by counting the number of unit squares that it covers. As we grow a little older--and hopefully a little wiser--we learn that we can more accurately compute the area of a shape by **integrating** the function that describes the shape over the relevant domain.\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\ dx\n$$\n\nWe've got a couple things to do, namely identifying the relevant curve $f(x)$ and the relevant domain $[a, b]$. To start, let's model the relevant curves as mathematical functions[^1]. Since, we're given that these are circles, we can recall the standard equation for a circle of radius $r$ centered at $(h, k)$:\n\n[^1]: Desmos is a great tool for visualizing and manipulating mathematical functions. You can find my Desmos file [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rshh1u6uoo).\n\n$$\n\\left(x-h\\right)^{2}+\\left(y-k\\right)^{2}=r^{2}\n$$\n\nLet's call the convex red circle $C_1$ and the concave green circle $C_2$. We can then write the equations for each as:\n\n$$\nC_1: \\left(x-r\\right)^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}\\ \\left\\{y\\ \\ge\\ 0\\right\\}\n$$\n\n$$\nC_2: \\left(x-r\\right)^{2}+\\left(y-r\\right)^{2}=r^{2}\\ \\left\\{y\\le r\\right\\}\n$$\n\nHere, I arbitrarily chose to center the circles at $(r, 0)$ and $(r, r)$, respectively. This is not a requirement, but it makes the equations simpler without changing the problem.\n\nLet's be smart as to how we'll integrate. Let's rotate the problem 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This will allow us to integrate over the $x$-axis, which to me *feels* much easier than integrating over the $y$-axis. Let's also use some handwavy symmetry to reduce the problem to a single curve $C_3$, recognizing that the two curves are reflections of each other across the $y$-axis at $y=\\frac{r}{2}$. So at a highlevel, we can integrate over the curve $C_3$ from $x=0$ to $x=\\frac{r}{2}$ and then double the result.\n\nThe relevant curve to integrate is then:\n\n$$\nC_3: \\left(x-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(y-r\\right)^{2}=r^{2}\\ \\left\\{0\\le x\\le \\frac{r}{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\n![](../../assets/posts/inscribed_circles/c3.png)\n\nYou'll notice something odd here; the curve fails the vertical line test and is thus not a function i.e. there are two $y$-values for the same $x$-value. This is a problem, as we can't integrate a non-function.\n\nTo get around this, we can split the curve into two parts, $C_3^+$ and $C_3^-$, where $C_3^+$ is the part of the curve that is above $y=\\frac{r}{2}$ and $C_3^-$ is the part of the curve that is below it.\n\nWe can conveniently discard $C_3^+$ by solving $C_3$ for $y$ and then taking the positive root.\n\n$$\nf(x) = r - \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(x-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2}\\ \\left\\{0\\le x\\le \\frac{r}{2}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nWhose domain of integration is then:\n\n$$\n[0, \\frac{r}{2}]\n$$\n\nThe area of the shaded region is then twice the integral of $f(x)$ over the domain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area} &= 2\\int_{0}^{\\frac{r}{2}} \\left(r - \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(x-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2}\\right) \\ dx \\\\\n&= 2\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\frac{r}{2}} r \\ dx - \\int_{0}^{\\frac{r}{2}} \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(x-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2} \\ dx\\right] \\\\\n&= 2\\left[\\frac{r^2}{2} - \\int_{0}^{\\frac{r}{2}} \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(x-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2} \\ dx\\right]\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe integral within $(3)$ is conveniently in the form $u = \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}$  which has the following solution[^2]\n\n$$\n\\int \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\ dx = \\frac{x}{2} \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} + \\frac{a^2}{2} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) + C\n$$\n\nWe can then use this to solve the integral within $(3)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\int_{0}^{\\frac{r}{2}} \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(x-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2} \\ dx &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(x - \\frac{r}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(x-\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2} + \\frac{r^2}{2} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x-\\frac{r}{2}}{r}\\right) \\bigg|_{0}^{\\frac{r}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\left[0\\right] - \\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\sqrt{3}r^2}{4}  +  \\frac{r^2}{2}\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= -\\frac{r^2}{2}\\left(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nPutting it all together, we can continue with $(3)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area} &= 2\\left[\\frac{r^2}{2} + \\frac{r^2}{2}\\left(\\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= 2\\left[\\frac{r^2}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= r^2\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) \\ \\square\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n[^2]: See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integrals_of_irrational_functions) for a list of integrals of irrational functions.\n\nOk, **phew**, that was a lot of work. But we've got the answer, which unsurprisingly[^3] is quadratic in $r$.\n\n[^3]: I say \"unsurprisingly\" because area is a two-dimensional quantity which measures surface. Given that every length in our problem is defined in $r$, any area we calculate *must* then be proportional to $r^2$.\n\nWe can sanity check our answer in a couple ways, e.g. by \"counting the squares\" or by approximating the curve of interest as two right-angled triangles, obtaining the area, and treating that as an upper bound on the area of the shaded region[^4].\n\n[^4]: The area of the two right-angled triangles is $\\frac{dr}{2}$ where $d$ is the \"height\" of the triangle, where $d \u003C r$.\n\n\nLet's now turn to the geometric reasoning and see if was can get the same answer.\n\n## Geometric Decomposition\n\nGeometry has never been my strong suit. Disclaimer aside, let's begin.\n\nAs is often the case in math, we must $R3$, that is *reject*, *reframe*, and *reduce*[^5] the problem. Here we start with a slightly different picture of the same setup:\n\n[^5]: In the same spirit as [\"gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/pwi7ar/what_the_hell_does_gaslight_gatekeep_girlboss_mean/).\n\n![](../../assets/posts/inscribed_circles/geometric.png)\n\nIt's an ugly picture but gets the point across. The key insight is that our desired area is the complement of $C_1$ \"cropped\" by the bounding box $B$ given by $2r \\times \\frac{r}{2}$. So,\n\n$$\n\\text{Area} = \\text{Area of } B - \\text{Area of } C_{cropped}\n$$\n\nThe area of $B$ is trivial: $2r \\cdot \\frac{r}{2} = r^2$. But how the heck do we find the area of $C_{cropped}$? Once again, we must $R3$. That cropped circle is nothing more than a semicircle of radius $r$ centered at $(r, r)$ \"cropped\" by the bounding box $B$\n\nHere's a new picture. The sector given by $ABC$ contains the portion of the semicircle that we want to exclude from the area of $C_{cropped}$, more specifically, the chord $AB$. Remember that a chord of a circle is a line segment that connects two points on the circle's circumference. The longest chord in a circle being its diameter, which passes through the center of the circle. \n\n![](../../assets/posts/inscribed_circles/sector.png)\n\nSo then,\n\n$$\n\\text{Area of } C_{cropped} = \\text{Area of semicircle } C_1 - \\text{Area of chord } AC\n$$\n\nIt doesn't end there however. While the area of the semicircle is trivial, the area of the chord is not.\n\n$$\n\\text{Area of chord } AC = \\text{Area of sector } ABC - \\text{Area of triangle } ABC\n$$\n\nThe area of the sector is fairly simple to inuit. A circle's area is $\\pi r^2$. The sector spans $\\theta$ radians, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the two radii. Given that a circle is $360^\\circ$ or $2\\pi$ radians, the area of the sector is then the fraction of the circle's area that the sector spans and so:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area of sector } ABC = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta\n$$\n\nThe area of of our (isosceles) triangle is also fairly simple to intuit. The base is some $a \\leq r$ and the height is some $h \u003C r$. It is obtaining $a$ and $h$ that is the tricky part.\n\nWe can use a combination of the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometry to obtain these quantities.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nh &= r \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{4r^2 - a^2} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na &= 2r \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\\\\n&= 2 \\sqrt{r^2 - h^2} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nGiven that the expression above are given in terms of $\\theta$, let's use the equation for the area of a triangle with sides $r$ in terms of $\\theta$:\n\n$$\n\\text{Area of triangle } ABC = \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can then use this to obtain the area of the chord using the expression we obtained above relating the area of the chord with the area of the sector and the area of the triangle:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area of chord } AC &= \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\sin\\left(\\theta\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\left(\\theta - \\sin\\left(\\theta\\right)\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nNote that the arc length of the sector is $s = r\\theta$, and so $\\theta = \\frac{s}{r}$ (important to emphasize that this is the angle in radians). What then is $\\sin\\theta$?\n\n$$\n\\sin\\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{a}{2r} \\Rightarrow \\sin\\left(\\theta\\right) = \\frac{a}{r} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\n We get the second part via the double angle identity which states that\n\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\theta\\right) = 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can now proceed with $(11)$ using $(7)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area of chord } AC &= \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\left(\\frac{s}{r} - \\frac{a}{r} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\left( \\frac{s}{r} - \\frac{ah}{r^2}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\left( \\frac{s}{r} - \\frac{a}{2r^2} \\sqrt{4r^2 - a^2} \\right) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWe pause here to think through getting an expression for $s$. The triangle we are dealing with is isosceles, and so the angle between the two radii is $\\theta$. As we've noted, the arc length $s$ of the sector is then $s = r\\theta$. What is also true is that\n\n$$\n\\theta = 2\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right) \\Rightarrow s = 2r\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nContinuing again, now being careful to eventually substitute $a$ and $h$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area of chord } AC &= \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\left( \\frac{2r\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right)}{r} - \\frac{a}{2r^2} \\sqrt{4r^2 - a^2} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} r^2 \\left( 2\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right) - \\frac{a}{2r^2} \\sqrt{4r^2 - a^2} \\right) \\\\\n&= r^2\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right) - \\frac{1}{4} a \\sqrt{4r^2 - a^2} \\\\\n&= r^2\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right) - h\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe cropped circle's area is then:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area of } C_{cropped} &= \\text{Area of semicircle } C_1 - \\text{Area of chord } AC \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 - \\left(r^2\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right) - h\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 - r^2\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right) + h\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAnd our area of interest is then:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area} &= \\text{Area of } B - \\text{Area of } C_{cropped} \\\\\n&= r^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 - r^2\\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right) + h\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}\\right) \\\\\n&= r^2\\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\arccos\\left(\\frac{h}{r}\\right)\\right) - h\\sqrt{r^2 - h^2}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nRecognizing in our setup that $h = \\frac{r}{2}$ we get our final answer:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Area} &= r^2\\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{r}{2}\\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(\\frac{r}{2}\\right)^2} \\\\\n&= r^2\\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r^2}{4}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWhich is really just $(6)$ in disguise!

In [a previous post](/posts/inscribed-circles), we tackled finding the area of a shaded region.

Our mission: find the total area of that diamond-shaped region nestled in the center.\n\nWhile numerical integration could solve this, we'll take the geometric route. Our focus here is building intuition and strategy, not wrestling with integrals.\n\n## Oh Geometry!\n\nWhen tackling geometric puzzles, I like to inventory what we already know and build from there.\n\nOur toolkit includes familiar formulas: squares have area $r^2$, circles have area $\\pi r^2$, and triangles with base $b$ and height $h$ have area $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. From our previous exploration, we also have a formula for the area of a chord segment that depends on the subtended angle $\\theta$ and radius $r$—let's call this $A_{\\text{chord}}(r, \\theta)$.\n\nTime to $R3$ this problem[^1].

Let's zoom in on $A_1$—the diagram below looks complex at first, but will clarify our approach.\n\n![](../../assets/posts/four_inscribed_circles/reduction.png)\n\n\nI've isolated the curve corresponding to $A_1$ and added sector $ABC$ for reasons that will soon become apparent. Our target region sits in the upper-left quadrant.\n\nFrom the diagram, $A_1$ equals the area of chord segment $AB$ plus the triangular area $\\frac{a^2}{2}$.\n\nFor the area of chord segment $AB$, we recall from our [previous post](/posts/inscribed-circles):\n\n$$\nA_{\\text{chord}}(r, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\left( \\theta - \\sin\\theta \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ (in radians) is the angle subtended by chord $AB$ at the circle's center.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nA_1 = \\frac{a^2}{2} + A_{\\text{chord}}(r, \\theta) \\\\\nA_1 = \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\left( \\theta - \\sin\\theta \\right)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nNow we face a choice: equation $(2)$ involves both $a$ and $\\theta$.

It's constrained by $\\theta + \\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$; the angles at the square's corner sum to a right angle.\n\nSo we'll express $a$ in terms of $\\theta$.

(COVID-19’s made me something of an arm-chair philosopher.) This serves as a first pass on the topic of Marxism, and an honest attempt to educate myself on Marxist thinking and its critiques of capitalism. I profess that this article is quite long, and that I’ll have certainly missed and/or oversimplified many things. For those oversights that are especially egregious, I trust you’ll bring them to my attention for further scrutiny. Because of its length, and the dryness of the topic, I’ve tried to make my writing fun (by which I really mean there’ll be numerous tangents), but for those spoilsports that don’t appreciate this Bella style, with enough interest, I’ll share a stripped down, more rigorous take.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Introduction \nIf you’re like me, the Marxist take you’ve heard usually goes like this: \n\n \nThere are two entities in society: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, who are linked through the bourgeoisie’s capital: the means of production that is made productive only by the labor of the proletariat. The bourgeois, concerned only for his own profit, undercuts at every turn the portion of surplus given to the proletarian as her compensation. He is a capitalist. Conversely, the proletarian’s interest lies in maximizing, or owning entirely, the surplus value of her labor. This wage-based relationship is naturally one-sided, and if it's not wholly exploitative, it’s parasitic. (Those acquainted with zero-sum game theory may recognize the similarities between this setup and the familiar Minimax games.)  \n\nWithin the fabric of capitalism is the exhortation of an unbridled and reckless accumulation of capital. Consequently, the institutions once intended to regulate the egoist nature of humankind, are inevitably coopted by the bourgeoisie to accrete for themselves further wealth at the expense of the proletariat and the environment. Certain elements of society, e.g. the government, the police, and the media, are the accomplices of the bourgeoisie and are enlisted to perpetuate their rule. The government is the appointed custodian of bourgeois capital, and the system through which the oppression of the proletariat is sanctioned. As for the police force, its raison d’être is the—often violent—protection of the capitalist and his property, while the media acts always to undermine proletariat unification efforts, cast doubt on Marxist thinking, scapegoat the proletariat for society’s moral and economic failings, and exaggeratedly laud capitalism for humankind’s positive accomplishments while absolving it of any wrong. \n\nTo overcome this oppression, the proletariat can upend this power imbalance either by reformist, gradual change (class collaboration), or, in the case of their total immiseration, revolutionary struggle. Those of the proletariat not interested in revolutionary advancement are the *lumpenproletariat* (a very cool sounding word amirite?). \n\nThis summarizes the Marxist take that I’m most familiar with, and provides the initial perspective with which I’m approaching this two-part article. In Part I, I’ll discuss the philosophical underpinnings of Marxism (as I understand it); contrast Marxism with capitalism; and chat about personal and private property and its relevance to capitalism. In Part II, I’ll deliberate on some points made by Marxist or socialist-minded people that I know in person, provide some criticisms of my own of capitalism, as well as balance out the discussion by given Marxism credit where it’s due. At the end, I’ll tie Parts I and II together as best as I can. The papers I’ve read will be shared at the end; one you'll see cited often is “In Defense of Marxism”. \n\n# Part I\n---\n## Philosoph-a, philosoph-e . . . i, o, u\n\n> He’d spoken many times to crowds in Ephebe, but they were invariably made up of other philosophers, whose shouts of “Bloody daft!,” “You’re making it up as you go along!” and other contributions to the debate always put him at his ease. That was because no one really paid any attention. They were just working out what they were going to say next. -- The great philosopher Didactylos from Terry Pratchett, Small Gods \n\nMarxists figuratively describe philosophy as a sword, a sword with which the worker (the proletarian) can cut himself free from the “Gordian knot which binds him to the mightiest obstacle in the way of the advancement of himself and his class — ignorance” (In Defense of Marxism).\n\nLet’s answer the glaring questions of what is philosophy and why it is important. Philosophy is the system of beliefs with which you interpret your thoughts, the behavior of others, and your environment. They are usually personal, and simultaneously consistent in certain applications while inconsistent or outright contradicting in others. For example, you may proclaim that everybody is singly responsible for their own moral enterprise (an existentialist), and yet regularly make allowances for trouble-making children that supposedly “don’t know any better”. To reconcile these inconsistencies, you can either qualify your philosophy with caveats and disclaimers, or scrap it for another philosophy altogether. Being unaware of what one practices philosophically is not the same thing as being without a philosophy—we all apply something daily, albeit we often do so unconsciously. Taken to the extreme, a failure to consciously define and practice your own philosophy is to default to the prevailing philosophy and its menagerie of contradictions.\n\n## Marxists = Materialists \nWestern philosophy is arguably split in two on the question of “how is reality known?”.  There are **idealists**, for whom the mind, spirit, and ideas exist before and separate of matter, i.e. consciousness exists outside of the brain. On the other side are **materialists**, for whom the mind and spirit are never outside of the intricate form of matter (our noggin) from which they originate; or restated, ideas are not independent, self-living things, but instead the result of mechanistic processes within the brain. As such, the various musings, philosophies and ideologies we’ve inherited from the great people of history, ought to be recognized predominantly as the interplay between the thinker and their material environment. Like many modern philosophers, Marxists are materialists, and as the man himself writes: “the idea is nothing else than the material world reflected in the human mind, and translated into forms of thought” and “life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.” (Karl Marx, Idealism and Materialism). \n\nGlancing at this briefly—but really because I enjoy being a contrarian—I have some gripes with materialism. For one, I think there is some merit to the philosopher George Berkley’s claim that all material objects owe their “existence” to a thinking/perceiving thing, *esse est percipi (aut percipere)*—to be is to be perceived (or to perceive). This is closely related to the popular philosophical thought experiment attributed to him, that if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Secondly, it seems to me that certain material things or phenomena are defined circularly. When asked seriously “what is x?”, I’ve heard clever blokes candidly say that “x is to which we attribute properties of x”, (x could be an electron or something or other), which to me implies that sometimes the idea, or abstraction, comes before the material, not after it. Thirdly, my **very** limited understanding of physics tells me that the precision of measurement that materialists rely on for their mechanistic explanations at the macroscopic scale cannot be similarly attained at the quantum scale. I’m also curious as to how a materialist would explain how time, the transmission of information, and probabilistic notions regarding systems (wave functions) can occur in mediums devoid of anything—see the first issue, or for that matter, give a material origin for the concept of “zero”. On all these things, my mind can be changed, so bring the debate, pick the time, and I’ll order pizza. (Once quarantine is over of course). \n\n## Marxism, Capitalism \nLike the contradictions found in nature, such as that found between the positive charge of a proton and the negative charge of an electron, there are also contradictions in capitalism. Marxists claim that within capitalism are innate contradictions stemming from the minimization-maximization organization of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. As a reminder, in the Marxist telling, the proletariat wants to maximize or own entirely the portion of surplus value derived from their labor, while the bourgeoisie seeks to minimize that portion. The bourgeoisie allegedly perpetuates itself through shady means and the defenseless proletariat is, for the most part, unaware of their oppression. This, in very crude terms, is the classical Marxist view on capitalism and its supposed effects.\n\nWhat may surprise you—it certainly surprised me—is that Marxism sees capitalism as a necessary and useful transitory stage; similar to how mankind necessarily underwent the transitions from barbarism to tribalism to feudalism in order to get to where we are now, in what I argue is an elevated human consciousness where the living conditions have improved tremendously for the majority of people. However, the next stage after capitalism, and even after socialism, is the “economy of superabundance” which is achieved by the “application of socialist planning to the industry, science and other technologies established by capitalism . . . [which] in turn will once and for all make redundant the division of labour, the difference between mental and manual labour, between town and countryside, and the wasteful and barbaric class struggle and enable the human race at least to set its resources to the conquest of nature” (In Defense of Marxism). Such an economy is communistic. I’d agree with this completely if not for two of the defining characteristics of socialist planning; namely, the strict requirement for enterprises to be managed (democratically) by workers, and the (near) abolition of private property. More on this later. \n\n## History repeats itself. An Interlude \nAccording to Marx, within our historical progression of socioeconomic systems, are perennial cycles—oft-quoted as history repeating itself—with its evolution driven by our struggle to reconcile the contradictions underlying the previous and contemporary system. Some contradictions however, are irreconcilable. So although I called Marxists materialists, modern Marxists are more accurately dubbed dialectical materialists—dialectics describe the evolution of a system that is driven by its contradictions. Marx’s collaborator, Friederich Engels, gave modern Marxism this view. Engels further claims that previous ideas, seemingly disproven, usually make a resurgence, this time enriched by previous experiences and discoveries—this comprises the concept of *the negation of negations*. So, although capitalism is (was) necessary, its entrenchment and inner contradictions have stagnated human progress, and has prevented us from moving onto the next transitory stage of socialism, after which ultimately comes the communist ideal.\n\nBecause I’ve witnessed many people conflating socialism, the economic system, with socialist policies, and erroneously treating them as interchangeable, I’ll tease them apart briefly. Socialism is an economic system in which the means of production, e.g. corporations today, are collectively owned and managed via socially planned worker cooperatives. On the other hand, socialist policies are things like social welfare, a social safety net, and related entitlements. The two are similar in that they both concern the collective, but theoretically speaking, socialism does not automatically imply socialist policies, nor vice versa. The same can be said even if we switch the term socialism with capitalism—many capitalistic European nations have strong socialist programs, e.g. the Nordic nations. (You might be surprised to learn that Sweden doesn’t have a government enforced minimum wage. I’m just as shocked as you are!)\n\nSide note. I personally think that our technological advancements and our attendant ability to make abundance, compels us to create strong social safety nets. Technology has substantially reduced the risk of failing to meet our basic physiological needs, e.g. refrigeration, storage, and the futures markets have enabled larger, more robust, food supply chains which can ostensibly eradicate hunger. To me, a reduction in risk ought to reduce the risk premium expected by shareholders or speculators, and in turn place pressure on industry to attain further economies of scale and to pass these resultant cost savings directly to the customer. (The shareholders invariably benefit if the product/service’s price point is within the purchasing power of the industry’s customer, which often includes the workers and shareholders of the industry themselves, or through “creative destruction” whose harm on the vulnerable will be alleviated by social nets.) At some point, the provision of a certain good or service, either becomes sufficiently cheap and/or ubiquitous enough, that it becomes an expectation, bordering on a right, rather than a commoditized privilege or luxury. Once a particular good or service has become a de-facto right in the minds of the public, then its most vocal members will (justifiably) lobby for it to be guaranteed by some large body, usually the government. Although this is not a tidy, simple process—it is hardly simple to demand something, and very often one’s demand can be derided as unrealistic and met by needlessly vitriolic opposition—I think it is necessary to ensure humankind continues to progress and raise our expectations pertaining to living a dignified life. I for one, am thankful to those that are quicker than I am to demand the things whose societal merits I'm slow to recognize. \n\n## Capitalism and Property \nNow let’s talk about capitalism directly. \n\nCapitalism’s primary concern is that of property, the protections for said property, and the unmolested and recognized ownership of said property: I may use or dispose of my property how I please, be it to sell, lease, or gift. In practice of course, there are limitations to property rights such that some property is illegal to own, e.g. other human beings; and nearly all property can be seized if certain conditions of the social contract aren’t met, e.g. evading your taxes or violating environmental regulations. \n\nNeedless to say, in prehistoric times, there was no justification for property ownership except that “Might made Right”. But today, the liberal[^1] justification for property typically follows that of John Locke. His labor theory of property claims that if a laborer applies herself to nature, by virtue of her labor, she is entitled to its resulting produce. This makes sense biologically; namely that the life-sustaining reactions involved in the synthesis of biomolecules don’t happen spontaneously, energy is needed to overcome conditions that are not thermodynamically favorable. To persevere efficiently, you put energy in only if you expect to realize something that exceeds the sum of your labor and all other opportunity costs, discounted over time. Locke further argues that because the laborer has the right to self-preservation, she also has the right to own the tools needed for her self-preservation; consequently, to him, property rights fall under natural rights. To be clear, I can’t readily agree that property rights are natural rights in the same way that we customarily acknowledge the right to having your own personal beliefs and values. The reason for my hesitation is twofold: (1) Taken by itself, nature is anarchic—only entropy can reasonably be called our “master”—thus, violations of property happen daily in nature, e.g. predators frequently steal the spoils (labor) of other predators. Property only meaningfully exists in multi-entity settings insofar that there are opportunities for it to be violated, unlike natural rights, which supposedly prevail within the individual themself and notwithstanding others, and for which our argument of their inalienability is predicated on some (non?)existent natural law[^2]. (2) In reality, property is not straightforward; it’s neither guaranteed to be easily divisible, nor is it generalizable; for example, when my labor is mixed with the labor of others, there is the fair question of how the rights over the produce is to be fairly dispensed. If rights over property were indeed a natural right, then the limitations for it would be arbitrary. Here it is better to be a consequentialist in that case-by-case, we choose limitations according to what best approximates our desired consequence.\n\n## Money and Biology \nIn biology class, I was taught that “ATP is the currency of the cell”, and so I’ve asked myself, is there a biological explanation for the need of money, currency? Wage labor is a crucial aspect of our capitalist system: we trade our time for stuff, usually money. Although some might claim that I’ve been indoctrinated, I believe time, labor, and money to be (almost) perfectly interchangeable. (I won’t discuss value). When we buy or sell something to others, or engage in universal production for sale, this is little more than us navigating the constraints imposed on us by the immediacy of life. Currency allows us to trade across space and time. If I were a laborer, supposing I am well rested and well fed today, I might be willing to exchange my labor now (for money) so that I may eat four days from now with minimal further exertion. The capitalist bias for surplus means that during times of normalcy, I get more food than what I pay for—this claim relies somewhat on the subjective theory value (more on this in Part II). This excess can tide me over whenever I don’t wish sell my labor. In an ideal capitalist system, probably that envisioned by Adam Smith, the risk that I can’t exchange my money for food days later is small, as is the risk that my labor is commanded by money rather than vice versa. These are some roseate claims that I’ll break down further in Part II. (For the sake of comparison, I talk about an ideal capitalist system just as I would an ideal socialist system. When I’ve asked socialists to point me to a socialist state in history or present-times, they tell me there is none, and those that proclaim themselves to be socialist are really something else, or on the way, i.e. premature. Admittedly, there are also capitalists that do this with regards to \"real capitalism\", so, we’ll compare red apples to striped apples.) With that said, currency itself has a few, relevant functions: it serves a store of “value”; a method of settling accounts with other actors, e.g. the state, and enable trust; a medium of exchange that reduces the costs of physical transaction; but most importantly, it facilitates the deferral of labor and investment, and acts as a hedge against “risk”[^3]. A communistic society is currency-less, whereas a socialistic one might retain some aspects of currency, i.e. you can use it to settle accounts, but you’d be prohibited from hoarding currency as a store of value or to hedge against future risk. \n\n## Capitalism's Myths? \nMarxists often make the distinction between personal and private property to abate misguided fears that they intend to collectivize your toothbrush. Personal property is primarily defined by occupancy and immediacy, e.g. the house you actively live in is an example of personal property, as is ownership of one’s own body. Conversely, private property may be owned in absentia and most crucially, is the sort of property that begets more property. Property with these qualities and the additional qualities of being legitimated by a legislative body, and bought or sold for currency is called capital. As far as I can tell, Marxists have no issue with personal property, but have qualms with private property. Recall that capital facilitates the oppression of a certain member of society, the proletariat. To be clear, there appears to be no checklist with which one can categorize their property as personal or private as it depends very greatly on the intent surrounding the use of said property. As a result, this particular Marxist argument smacks of the arbitrariness with which gun buffs allow for certain types of munitions for civilian use, but disallow others, despite the same overall “intent” to cause violence. A social (or legal) system is made less stable when ambiguities abound. \n\nSome Marxists assert that “private property is a myth” (In defense of Marxism), with no basis in reality or nature other than the insistence of dishonest capitalists. I agree that the interpretation of natural rights over private property is artificial, but I disagree that private property is itself a myth. To assert that private property is neither a myth nor an invention of the capitalists, I’ll attempt to show that property owned in absentia, and that ownership/care for property that begets more property, exist in species other than humans. (We can speculate at another time as to whether other species would have private property and complex wage systems in the same exact sense we do if they too had a trust-enabling currency of exchange.) \n\nWhy do I suggest we make this argument? For one, we can reasonably assume that the majority of other species don’t contemplate whether or not they are oppressing one another, and as far as I know, do not oppress each other willfully[^4]. Additionally, I contend that the well documented behaviors of animals caching food, and scenting or marking their possessions may be considered primitive expressions of property. Let’s elaborate further using the damselfish, and see if I can convincingly claim, that in the wildest sense, their relationship with property and with each other, is like that of humans and our relationship with private property.\n\nThe damselfish is a fish that engages in cultivation mutualism with a particular type of algae, which the fish grows and cultivates in gardens. As passionate gardeners, the damselfish vigorously defends the territory surrounding its garden(s) against opportunistic invaders, and itself makes the occasional foray outside of its own territorial borders for “conquest”[^5]—as I understand it, if it fails to find a suitable place to relocate, it returns to whence it came, but the original garden is owned in absentia in the interim. The aggression with which it defends its gardens is proportional to the garden’s quality and the quantity of algae and so the damselfish can differentiate between its competitors and non-competitors and may “work together” so long as all participants benefit. (It is unclear whether all the participating fish need to benefit equally). The damselfish that fail to establish or mutualistically tend to territories are relegated to a non-propertied floating population. From this, we can surmise that: (1) Damselfish consider gardens to be their own property to the extent that they actively exclude other herbivores and damselfish for their exclusive and (non)immediate consumption—which in the crudest, crudest sense, necessitates an initial enclosure of the commons. (2) The property has some value to them and other fish, and distinctions between the propertied and non-propertied, as well as distinctions between competitor and non-competitor. (3) That this property naturally begets more property—the damselfish cultivates the algae and removes weeds to encourage its proliferation—and by mutualism, theft, or outright conquest may benefit, possibly “unfairly”, from the labor of other damselfish. And finally, (4) that the property is occasionally owned in absentia for lengths of time. The similarities between these gardens and private property are, at least to me, evident, except for one striking difference: the damselfish does not market its produce globally, nor as far as we can tell, sell its labor[^6]; hence why I encourage we speculate at another time as to whether this can only ever happen in species with some notion of spoken language and long-term exchange. Read more about these aquatic gardeners here: [The Algal Community of the Farmer Damselfish](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4608503?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)\n\nThe difference between us and animals, is that as big-brained humans, who for whatever reason are concerned about the welfare of lawyers, we’ve enshrined the protections and recognitions of our private property in laws upheld by a social contract—the state and its courts—which provide the guidance on what property is thusly protected, under which conditions it is protected, and the punishments meted out for violations of another’s property. If this weren’t the case, then just like the lawyer-less damselfish, we’d simultaneously be farmers and opportunistic invaders that seek to appropriate the labor of others where possible without compunction.\n\nTherefore, neither personal or private property are unjust instruments of oppression anymore than nature is itself an instrument of oppression. Rather, private property comes from an innate desire of ownership found in many creatures, and capitalism attempts to encourage the peaceful (re)allocation of private property. With that said, the problems concerning property in the modern day (i.e. wealth inequality) lie within the bodies erected to express this desire, i.e. state sanctioned inheritance laws and other provisions that enable what I believe to be the undeserved accumulation of property/capital, as well as other statist things that have given rise to the exploitation at the scales of imperialism, colonialism, and stalinism. However, because I fail to see the inherent flaws or contradictions regarding these property rights as discussed, I must disagree with those Marxists who seek to utterly dismantle capitalism on the basis that private property is a myth and the root of all present evil. If I may opine here—which I’ve been doing all this while—nothing can elevate a person’s condition better than their own ability and interest in using their private faculties and property to accomplish these aims.\n\n## Previous (Primitive) Accumulation of Capital\nWhere I agree very strongly with Marx is his refutation of Adam Smith’s idyllic explanation for how the original propertied and non-propertied came about. As Wikipedia describes it, “Adam Smith’s account of primitive original accumulation depicted a peaceful process, in which some workers labored more diligently than others and gradually built up wealth, eventually leaving the less diligent workers to accept living wages for their labour.” \n\nThis is important to consider because the previous accumulation of capital, or lack thereof, is one explanation as to why people occupy the stations they do today. While it is certainly true that some of our ancestors toiled diligently to make an honest living, we also inherit from our ancestors property that was forcibly taken from another, or obtained through lying, cheating and stealing. (Some of our ancestors were possibly enslaved at some point.) Therefore, the current power structures and entitlement to property are legitimated considerably by historical incidents. I can’t in good faith say that the process of the original accumulation of property was decisively peaceful.\n\nHere’s where I’m stuck. On the one hand, those who have benefitted from ill-gotten spoils ought to recognize it, and see to it they rectify the demonstrable harm caused by these spoils. On the other hand, this is nigh impossible to do fairly for several reasons, i.e. everybody’s been harmed differently (e.g. emotionally, physically or monetarily), and everybody’s got their own sense of justice. What makes matters worse is the relentless march of time; those that justifiably perceive themselves to be oppressed (or believe their ancestors to have been exploited), will feel evermore slighted, cheated, and marginalized, while those that have benefitted or can no longer easily see how they continue to benefit from this privilege, will be dismissive or outright hostile to the former group. I sometimes wish we could just “pause time” so that we may address everybody’s issues all at once and have for ourselves a grand reset . . . but then I think to myself, no one would agree to such a thing. There are those on either side who benefit from the current poor state of affairs. With that said, I don’t think this phenomena is unique to either capitalism or Marxism. In the former, greed can propel the unchecked accumulation of property, while in the latter, envy of the more immaterial things can drive disenchantment and conflict, which to me eventually turns into the parceling of ‘yours’ and ‘mine’ resulting in a form of private ownership tainted by loathing for one another rather than founded on the merits of mutualism. On this final point, in a democratically managed enterprise, one may misleadingly attribute their being snubbed/ignored to external factors, such as someone else’s height, charisma, or other superficial qualities that may “unfairly” accord them disproportionate sway over the direction of the enterprise. This may lead some to undermine the good of the enterprise for their own selfish reasons. To me, the most recent and well-known Marxist experiments—despite the insistence that there are no real, recent socialist societies—make a god of “people-influence” in place of the conventional capitalist gods of private property and money. \n\n---\nThis concludes Part I. In Part II, I’ll immediately go into deliberating some points made by Marxist friends of mine (e.g. Marx’s labor value theory), and talking about some deserved criticisms of capitalism by adding some criticisms of my own. I’ll also balance out the discussion by giving Marxism credit where it’s due. I’ll then conclude with some observations I’ve made of the archetypal proponents of both Marxism and capitalism, and introduce the beginnings of my \"own\" system. \n### End of Part I\n\n[^1]: Liberalism and the left are distinct political categories. My use of liberal(ism) here is that of the philosophical one discussed in the writings of people like John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and Immanuel Kant.\n[^2]: For a related discussion on whether natural rights actually exist, read my post [\"Musings on Dignity\"](/2020-03-23-dignity). \n[^3]: Risk is a very interesting.

Animals may also produce for their community and for those to which they are not directly genetically related. “An animal only produces what it immediately needs for itself or its young. It produces one-sidedly, whilst man produces universally. It produces only under the dominion of immediate physical need, whilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only truly produces in freedom therefrom. An animal produces only itself, whilst man reproduces the whole of nature. An animal’s product belongs immediately to its physical body, whilst man freely confronts his product.” (Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts)","src/content/posts/marxism.mdx","2b9608682d9bac58","marxism.mdx","may-things-go-the-ideal-way",{"id":233,"data":235,"body":239,"filePath":240,"digest":241,"legacyId":242,"deferredRender":22},{"title":236,"date":237,"tags":238},"May Things Go The Ideal Way",["Date","2023-08-25T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"I’ve often said\n\nMay things go the ideal way\n\nand so furiously do I urge it on\n\nthat much like a boy,\n\nwho in his little sail boat\n\nwill blow furiously against her sails\n\nsupremely confident that with his lungs alone\n\nand the strength of their combined, forceful, breathy desire\n\nand perhaps with the aid of softer, lapping waves beneath him\n\nthat his little sail boat\n\nshall carry him to the shore plain in sight\n\nto revel in golden sands.\n\nin which none have played.\n\nso I pray,\n\nhands clasped and breath poised for swift exhale—\n\n*May things go the ideal way.*","src/content/posts/may-things-go-the-ideal-way.mdx","428766e8c95fbfc8","may-things-go-the-ideal-way.mdx","moonlight",{"id":243,"data":245,"body":249,"filePath":250,"digest":251,"legacyId":252,"deferredRender":22},{"title":246,"date":247,"tags":248},"Moonlight",["Date","2023-11-12T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"How perfect you looked beneath the moonlight,\n\nSo I bought the moon and named it after you,\n\nWove the stars into our own constellation,\n\nAnd wrapped your tapestry in the velvety black of night,\n\nAnd in our marble pavilion, gathered fairies to play our song on moonflower trumpets,\n\nBut, it was a gift you were surprised to receive.\n\nDarling, why must you hurt me so?","src/content/posts/moonlight.mdx","02f6d46dd22b2341","moonlight.mdx","misc-hands",{"id":253,"data":255,"body":260,"filePath":261,"digest":262,"legacyId":263,"deferredRender":22},{"title":256,"date":257,"tags":258},"Channeling my Inner da Vinci, Miscellaneous Hand Drawings",["Date","2020-01-22T00:00:00.000Z"],[259],"drawings","A recurring theme of mine is that shortly after reading a book, particularly a biography, I'll pick up a few things from the story's protagonist and try to implement them in my own life.

We hiked a two-night, 20-mile loop through shrub and granite. The mosquitoes, undeterred by our repellent or optimism, treated us as an all-you-can-eat buffet. My friends joked that I came back \"bigger,\" courtesy of visibly swollen biceps from the sheer number of bites.\n\nFor whatever reason (or perhaps very obvious ones), our group of six gentlemen spent much of the trail—somewhere between bushwhacking and stargazing—discussing consciousness.

But there was one shared intuition: consciousness has a vibe. Some things feel more conscious than others. And being alive doesn't necessarily mean being conscious.\n\n## I Am, Therefore...\n\nMy own stake in the ground was that consciousness begins with the ability to declare, *I am.* That simple phrase signals self-awareness; a recognition that there is such a thing as an \"I,\" capable of experiencing the rich tapestry of anger, longing, sadness, hope, and more. Nested within *I am* are its temporal echoes: *I was*, acknowledging memory and a past; *I will be*, recognizing foresight and a future; and finally—what I see as a declaration of man's agency over his present—*I must.*\n\nOne friend challenged my \"I am\" criterion almost immediately. To him, it felt too human-centric. I see his point. *I am* presumes language or some form of expressive behavior. It leans heavily on empathy and interpretation. I instinctively grant consciousness to fellow mammals—lock eyes with a dog and it feels like someone is looking back. But that instinct falters with ants, or those relentless mosquitoes. Am I perceiving their consciousness, or merely projecting mine onto them? If I rely solely on this empathetic instinct, my definition becomes a slippery slope: the less a creature resembles me in form or behavior, the less inclined I am to deem it conscious. And if these vastly different beings are in fact conscious in some profound, metaphysical sense, then my anthropocentric yardstick does us all a tremendous disservice.\n\nThat question forced me to reconsider what counts as evidence. Maybe \"being-ness\" requires repeated, intentional expression. A dog barks, begs, nudges. It has personality. But what about an ant? Ants, it turns out, communicate with surprising sophistication. Through chemical signals, they convey identity, origin, even intent. I could almost hear the carpenter ants as they excavated the logs we'd sat on, sawdust piling up beside them—one ant saying to another: \"Ave, I am so-and-so, from such-and-such, on a mission to do this-and-that. You are who-and-who and ought to help me with this-and-that.\"\n\nBut then again, couldn't a sufficiently advanced machine do the same? Store memories, articulate goals, simulate intention? If both AI and ants can pass this bar, then consciousness must be something more than communication or goal-directed behavior.\n\nThat same friend didn't have a definitive answer either. Instead, he tumbled headfirst into what I later learned is a flavor of panpsychism: the idea that all things—down to inert rocks—possess consciousness. If we define consciousness as the capacity to respond to the environment, then rocks, which may expand, contract, or erode under pressure, qualify.\n\nWhile appealing in its inclusivity, this framing risks diluting the term \"consciousness\" to the point where it no longer captures the subjective experience we associate with it. If a rock's reaction to sunlight counts the same as a child's joy or a dog's excitement what are we really measuring? His rebuttal was that any difference lies in the perceived complexity between them. I'm not convinced.\n\nAnother friend, more skeptical still, cut the Gordian knot: Maybe nothing is conscious, he said—or at least, we're utterly unequipped to know for sure. If we can't rigorously define consciousness, how can we confidently attribute it? In his view, we're like cartographers trying to map the landscape of the mind with tools made from the same mud and timber that form the terrain itself.\n\nYet another friend took a theistic stance. He argued that no material explanation would ever suffice—that consciousness is rooted in the soul. To him, it was irreducible, not emergent. God, measuring out one soul per person.\n\n## Mind Over Matter? Or the Other Way Around?\n\nI've wrestled with these questions before. Years ago, I wrote about the tension between materialism and idealism; the age-old debate about whether mind gives rise to matter or vice versa. Idealists claim consciousness precedes the physical, that reality is born of mind or spirit. Materialists argue the opposite: that mind is a product of matter in motion, the result of neurons firing and molecules doing their dance.\n\nI still find materialism attractive. But even here, the ground can feel shaky. I've seen definitions of physical things loop in on themselves, like saying an electron is that which exhibits the properties of an electron. It's a circularity that smacks of capitulation, hinting that perhaps the idea of something has primacy over the material it purports to define.\n\nThen there's the quantum weirdness. At the macroscopic scale, materialism gives us confidence in what we can weigh, measure, and model. But at the quantum scale? Certainty collapses into probability, into wave functions, into that maddening superposition of states. What even is matter down there? And how do we reconcile information, time, and the very concept of \"zero\" with a purely material substrate? Can you assign a physical origin to nothingness?\n\nThese aren't knock-out punches to materialism, but they're not soft jabs either. They reveal that the ground beneath our certainties is shakier than we'd like.\n\nTo be fair, idealism and the soul aren't off the hook, either. That view risks hand-waving at mystery instead of explaining it—especially when it fails to show how mind gives rise to consistent, shared material reality. A world where the mind invents the world is poetic but veers toward solipsism (which I find—yawn—boring).\n\n## Neither Here Not There\n\nSo I'm left unconvinced by both, and yet drawn to the questions they keep alive.\n\nWe didn't resolve the matter, of course. It's been a week or two, and the conversation still pops up from time to time. I've little choice but to keep chewing on it, perhaps destined to wander deeper into a befuddlement of increasing Dostoyevskian proportions.\n\nBut maybe that's the point. Maybe these spirals are best reserved for the trail.","src/content/posts/on-consciousness.mdx","c8456a2f09f91553","on-consciousness.mdx","nozick",{"id":285,"data":287,"body":291,"filePath":292,"digest":293,"legacyId":294,"deferredRender":22},{"title":288,"date":289,"tags":290},"Robert Nozick on the Redistributive State",["Date","2020-11-24T00:00:00.000Z"],[122,123],"**Author's note:** I'd written this piece for a class on Justice at MIT in\nresponse to a prompt--however, as per the professor's request, I will not be sharing the\nprompt; that said, the article remains readable even without prior\nknowledge of the prompt I'm responding to. (Note that because this article\nwas written for a class, with very minor edits, the style and structure of writing is different to other\narticles on my blog, i.e. it's a lot more academic than usual.) \n\n A\nlittle bit about [Robert Nozick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nozick):\nRobert Nozick was an American political philosopher best known for his work \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\", a\nbook in which he argues that only a minimal \"watchman-like\" state is societally justified.\nHe makes this claim that such a state minimizes the extent of and\nthe number of violations of the rights of individuals among all possible states. I don't quite agree with Nozick in some\nsubstantial ways, but his work, particularly his thoughts on what makes a\nutopia, are worth responding to.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Introduction \nPeople are generally divided on the issue of a state using its powers to coerce individuals into aiding others, the jurisdiction regarding the exercise of these powers, and when it is—if ever—justified. On the question of redistribution (which I define formally in Section I), Utilitarians champion a state with the power to redistribute wealth as needed to eliminate inequality; in opposition, Libertarians like Robert Nozick assert that a state should never overstep its only role as a guarantor of property rights and a facilitator of just and free exchange among consenting adults--i.e. a “night-watchman” state--that is, irrespective of any resulting inequalities.[^1] The difference in opinion between Utilitarians and Nozick effectively comes down to differing treatments of the rights individuals have over wealth. As such, I will first describe Nozick’s interpretation, the so-called entitlement theory of justice, in Section I. Then, I describe in detail two of Nozick’s arguments against the redistributive state: first, that the redistributive state is contrary to the natural rights of individuals, and that taxation, a form of redistribution, is on par with forced-labor (Section II); and second, that there are examples of wealth distributions (e.g. his famous Wilt Chamberlain example) for which any subsequent redistribution would be rebuked as unjust by any reasonable person (Sections III and IV). \n\nWithin these sections of the paper, I will provide my own comments in rebuttal. To Nozick’s first point, I will conclude that the equivalency made between taxes and forced labor is false by way of a counterexample. As for his second point, I will argue that the ambiguities regarding landownership within the Wilt Chamberlain example weaken its persuasiveness; nevertheless, I conclude by describing how said example can be improved without violating Nozick’s principles, i.e. those contained within his entitlement theory of justice. \n\n## I. Entitlement Theory of Justice\nNozick’s entitlement theory states that a distribution of wealth in society is\njust if and only if every member of society is entitled to their portion. Nozick\nprovides the following three principles, for which, if at least one is observed\nand none is violated, an individual is justly entitled to their wealth:[^2]\n\n1. *Justice in acquisition* concerns the ownership of previously unowned things; one can come to own something if doing so doesn’t leave others worse off.\n    \n2. *Justice in transfer* says that one can acquire wealth by free exchange with others, or through a gift. \n   \n3. *Rectification of injustice* concerns how one might deal with wealth that was unjustly acquired or transferred, compensation given to the aggrieved, and other similar questions related to past transgressions. \n\nFormally, redistribution entails seizing the private earnings of some group $$A$$, to give to some possibly intersecting group $$B$$, i.e. taxation. Assuming $$A$$’s earnings were acquired justly--as defined by the principles above--their nonconsensual appropriation is an injustice in itself, says Nozick, notwithstanding the amount of positive benefit that $$B$$ obtains.[^3] With Nozick’s entitlement theory in mind, I will now explore how “nonconsensual appropriation” constitutes an injustice by examining “consent”. \n\n## II. Inalienable Rights\nAccording to Nozick, people have certain inalienable rights by virtue of being\nhuman. One such right enshrines the sovereignty of the individual and the\nprivilege of the individual to act however they please, provided they observe\nthe negative freedoms of others.[^4] Therefore, any state capable of coercion that\ngoes beyond its role as a minimal night-watchman is inherently at odds with said\nrights. I’ll formalize Nozick’s claim as follows: one’s sovereignty is violated\nif and only if they are coerced into a state, $$s′$$, without their consent.[^5] This claim rests upon the reasonable premises that: (1) an individual is capable\nof giving explicit consent; (2) no one can grant consent on the behalf of\nanother; (3) the observance of negative rights is sufficient to define what is\njust, or at least what is not definitively unjust; (4) with regards to the\nun/just treatment of an individual, it comes down to whether or not consent was\ngranted; and (5) the desirability of $$sʹ$$ doesn’t diminish the need for prior\nconsent.\n\nReferring back to the formal definition of redistribution in Section I,\nUtilitarians argue that if the total benefits experienced by $$B$$’s members\nexceeds the total losses experienced by those in $$A$$, then such a transfer of\nwealth is just because it increases happiness/utility in aggregate. Usually, the\nsets $$A$$ and $$B$$ have a nonzero intersection (e.g. although we’re taxed, we\nalso enjoy the benefits of the amenities and infrastructure the tax funds).\nHowever, like Nozick, I find the idea that taxes are always paid voluntarily\nspecious: short of abandoning society altogether, we are wholly unable to\ndictate which taxes we wish to pay and which we wish to abstain from. \n\nAccording to Nozick, there is an additional way in which redistributive taxation\nis unjust; he makes the argument that taxation is morally equivalent to forced\nlabor[^6], the implication being that forced labor is unjust because it is by\ndefinition obtained without consent. This implication rests upon the *Lockean\nproviso*, which was later amended by Nozick (his amendment is not relevant here\nand thus omitted.) The proviso says, in brief: self-ownership entails exclusive\nownership over one’s labor and the fruits of one’s labor when it [labor] is\nmixed with natural resources.[^7] As such, if one’s taxable earnings are $$x$$,\nthen after taxes, a portion of $$x$$ is uncompensated labor, i.e. labor done\nfreely, and is thus in violation of the Lockean proviso. One might argue,\nhowever, that this view isn’t universally true. The following argument might be\nespecially convincing to those who believe that it is only what one perceives\nwhich determines their own reality, i.e. subjective reality. (This is a view I\nam not personally fond of; I can anticipate several unsavory logical\nimplications). First, assume, as I’ve described earlier, that an action done\nupon an individual is unjust if consent was expressly not given. Second, assume\nthat, practically speaking, consent can neither be given nor explicitly withheld\nin situations wherein an individual has no knowledge whatsoever of the action to\nwhich they’d otherwise consent (the “consentable” action) and of which they\ncontinue to remain unaware their entire lives. From the vantage point of the\nwould-be consenter, consent in these cases is ambiguous. (Ambiguous in the sense\nthat although you might lean one way or the other, you do so on intuition rather\nthan a predefined set of logical reasons). It follows that, subjectively\nspeaking, whether something is definitively just or unjust is also ambiguous. Of\ncourse, objectively speaking, that is from the vantage point of an entity with\nperfect knowledge, consent was not given because the question is binary: an\n“either-or”, rather than an “either-or-maybe” in the imperfect knowledge\nsetting. \n\nLet’s contextualize the argument above by supposing that an individual $$I$$ derives an income of $$x$$ from a subscription-based business model to which there are $$k$$ yearly subscribers. Consider first the situation in which $$I$$ is aware of their tax liability; here $$I$$ indeed renders a service for free and is effectively forced in doing so as Nozick suggests. (Here, one might argue that because $$I$$ continues to labor despite their awareness of a tax, they must be doing so willingly. However, we need only apply this same reasoning to wage agreements to see the deficiency in this argument: an employee may begrudgingly agree to an abysmally low wage out of desperation or an imbalance in power between herself and her employer. In such a case, we intuitively feel that some injustice has been committed “agreement” notwithstanding--consistency demands that similar intuition applies in $$I$$’s case).  \n\nNow, consider the situation in which $$I$$ is totally unaware of any tax liability (because they’re not the one paying it). If the tax is levied on the $$k$$ subscribers and not on $$I$$, then, while it is true that $$I$$ takes home a diminished xʹ (due to the tax’s downward effect on demand), from $$I$$’s knowledge-constrained vantage point, they did not “technically” render any of their labor for free. This is one such situation in which some party is taxed, and the other party, due to a lack of knowledge, is not performing any free, forced labor as Nozick would otherwise have us believe—subjectively speaking of course. Therefore, the equivalence Nozick makes between redistribution and forced labor is not universally true; it depends partly on one’s beliefs regarding subjective and objective realities. I will now turn my attention to Nozick’s compelling Wilt Chamberlain example. \n\n \nOne might ask the following in rebuttal: \"if I lie to you and you don’t find\nout, is it the case that I did not lie? If I steal from you and you don’t know,\nis it the case that I did not steal?\" \n\n Yes, objectively speaking, me not\nknowing that you’ve stolen from me doesn’t eliminate the fact that you stole from\nme, i.e. a tree whose felling no one witnessed is still a felled tree. But so\nwhat? If you later confessed that you’d robbed me--a robbery I up to that point\nnever knew of--then the harm to me (that is attributable to your thievery)\nmaterializes only because I in some way revise my life from the time that the theft purportedly\nhappened to the time of your confession, and from there conclude I have indeed been worse\noff because of your theft. If you never confess, then although I might’ve long\nbeen aware that I’ve suffered some type of loss, I’ve long chalked it up to my bad luck at\nbest, or a “blameless case of theft” at worst (blameless in the sense I can’t\npoint fingers at anyone without myself possibly committing an injustice of false\naccusations). \n\n This stems from how I think of justice: only another human can do an\ninjustice onto another human. Any “injustice\" you suffer that is not\nattributable to a person or to the conditions made by several persons, then the\ntype of injustice you’ve suffered is bad luck, it is a “cosmic injustice” so to speak, e.g.\nthat I am born lame in one arm does not give me license (generally speaking) to\nblame anyone but the universe (or God if you prefer). Similar thinking applies in the theft case.\nThe box of what I know to be the world at the time of an event usually includes\nmyself, some other actors, and our environment. If, as far as I can tell, you\nare no longer in that box, then your theft, subjectively speaking, takes on the\nform of a cosmic injustice rather than a \"human injustice”. This is the same\nthought with the tax. If the subscription provider $$I$$, as I’ve described, is\ntaxed by the government without knowing it, then the only things they can say in\nlight of receiving a diminished income is: “Huh, I’ve fewer subscribers than I\nnormally do. Strange. Perhaps they no longer enjoy my content, perhaps some no\nlonger have the discretionary funds for my subscription, etc. etc.” Now, I don’t mean\nto claim that all of these speculations are blameless, but none of them have the\nIRS as $$I$$’s “blamee”--mostly because of my stipulation that $$I$$ is not directly\ntaxed. \n\n I’ve said all this, but I don’t realllllllly buy it, not because I think the\nlogic is flawed, but because there is no way one can guarantee the continued ignorance of another with respect\nto an action/injustice they've committed against them. The lack of this guarantee\nmeans that at any point in the future, upon their realization, one's action will\nhave been harmful subjectively speaking, and (somehow) become an injustice for\nall time before that realization, and all the time after it. (It become a human\ninjustice for which one can assign blame.)\n\n## III. Wilt Chamberlain Example\nCan one construct a sequence of processes $$\\alpha$$ (an execution) that takes an egalitarian distribution $$D_1$$ at a time $$t_1$$ and transforms it into a highly unequal distribution $$D_2$$ at $$t_2$$ where $$t_1 \u003C t_2$$, and for which no reasonable person can properly call $$\\alpha$$ unjust? If so, then it follows that redistributing the shares of wealth in $$D_2$$ would be unjust (because $$D_2$$ is just) and would be a strong argument against the state’s coercive apparatus. Nozick certainly believes we can construct such a case, and presents his popular Wilt Chamberlain example as an instance of $$\\alpha$$. For the sake of saving space, rather than quote Nozick directly, I will reproduce in my own words the argument that emerges from his example; that said, please read the passage for yourself because my comments that follow are made against his original presentation (Ibid., p. 160-161). The argument goes: \n\n1. An arbitrary distribution $$D_1$$ is just if and only if it follows a certain egalitarian structure, i.e. everyone has equal shares of the total wealth. (Premise held by Nozick’s egalitarian critics). \n   \n2. People are free to transfer things between themselves if it is consensual. This is just; recall justice in transfer in Section I. \n   \n3. By some execution $$\\alpha$$, which can include many transfer processes between individuals, we may obtain from $$D_1$$ a new distribution $$D_2$$. \n    \n4. If no reasonable person can argue that $$\\alpha$$ is unjust with respect to its constituting parts, then one cannot conversely claim that $$D_2$$ is unjust. For the sake of completeness, $$\\alpha$$ must be just and $$D_2$$ must also be just.  \n\nFrom (2) and (3), it is clear that the 25 cents given freely by each of one million persons over Wilt Chamberlain’s season composes a just execution $$\\alpha$$. The majority of reasonable people cannot see anything egregiously unjust with the Chamberlain scenario as presented (more on this later), and so from (4) we can conclude that the final distribution is indeed just. However, this result contradicts (1), which states that an arbitrary distribution is just only if it follows some egalitarian structure, i.e. $$D_2$$ is not egalitarian but is still just. This concludes Nozick’s argument and his desired result. \n\nThat said, when presented with this scenario, although people aren’t quite able to articulate why, they intuitively feel that said result is wrong (I say this anecdotally): “surely not all distributions are just despite their causative executions being themselves just”. I am one of such people, and I believe I have pinpointed, at least for myself, where the issue lies: I take issue with the hidden premise that people “cheerfully attend” these games and give their money freely. There are opportunity costs (those that concern land ownership/use) which Chamberlain exacts on others that go uncompensated and unmentioned—the final distribution $$D_2$$ is thus unjust insofar that these injustices are neither corrected nor acknowledged. Since Nozick’s entitlement theory accommodates redistribution in rectification of historical injustice, I will not be rejecting Nozick’s brand of Libertarianism outright but rather propose clarifications to remove the ambiguities that undermine the persuasiveness of his Wilt Chamberlain example.  \n\n## IV. Comments on Wilt Chamberlain \nIn this section I will attempt to: (1) define the conditions under which consent is truly given in a spirit similar to Section II, and (2) evaluate whether Nozick’s Libertarian tradition is compatible with my own observations regarding opportunity cost in his Wilt Chamberlain example.  \n\nWhat does it mean for consent to be given? Consider again the employer and employee briefly mentioned in Section II. Some believe that any wage contract entered into “voluntarily” is by definition just, because the involved parties, via their own mental calculus, concluded that the benefits obtained from engaging in said contract exceeded those without. This is only superficially true. From the vantage point of the employee, certain economic conditions outside her control might force her to accept a wage lower than her “objective” worth (the wage her labor would otherwise fetch in a more favorable setting). So, although consent was given, the consentable options presented are themselves artificially constrained insofar economic conditions are the result of the combined actions of people other than said employee. The employee can rightly complain that an injustice has been committed, especially if there are other superior employment options to which she would have readily consented. I will now argue that in the Wilt Chamberlain example, the usage of land, to the exclusion of others, for the purpose of playing basketball, which presumably wasn’t democratically agreed upon, imposes a similar cost on the attendees for which they must be compensated for $$D_2$$ to be just. Before doing so, I make the following economic assertions about land: \n\n1. There are three factors of production and their associated returns, these are: labor (wages), land (rents), and capital (interest). By land I mean location in three-dimensional space and other natural resources; those occurring without humans. We can observe that no productive enterprise can take place without being situated somewhere in space and that land comes materially before labor and capital. \n   \n2. Land occurred naturally and is in fixed supply. No person can increase it, nor diminish it. No number of people can occupy the same point in space at the same time, and so land is inherently rivalrous and excludable, which is further enhanced by our (Western) conception of property rights.\n     \n3. Consequently, no individual can properly claim rents in perpetuity. (Any private claim on its rents is unearned). Because nobody is entitled to it, practicality demands that all of society is entitled to it, or more precisely, society’s members are owed some, possibly equal, portion of its rents, i.e. the rents are made common. Nozick admits a similar albeit weaker assertion: “An owner’s property right in the only island in an area does not allow him to order a castaway from a shipwreck off his island as a trespasser […] Notice that the theory does not say that owners do not have these rights, but that the rights are overridden to avoid some catastrophe.” [^8]\n\nIn light of the aforementioned assertions, the Chamberlain example can be made unambiguous. I’ll describe one way of doing so. For the purpose of the narrative, suppose that Wilt Chamberlain owns the land on which he’s also paid to play basketball. Further suppose that said land rests upon an oil reserve, and that all other land is similarly held in private. If it were put to a vote, we might observe that those in the community strongly prefer extracting the oil to watching basketball. Therefore, Wilt Chamberlain using the land to play basketball runs contrary to these interests, and so according to assertion 3, imposes an opportunity cost on the game’s attendees (those belonging the community). As a result, the 25 cents, which is merely the assessed value of watching Wilt Chamberlain play basketball, contains an increment which properly belongs to society on account of his private appropriation of common rents. (In fact, the opportunity cost might very well exceed the 25 cents, in which case, Wilt Chamberlain pays the attendees). This, I believe, is the particular injustice which makes me and others hesitant to laud $$\\alpha$$ and $$D_2$$ just. An acknowledgment of this land question, and an invocation of the third principle of the entitlement theory, justice in rectification (possibly via a tax on the value of land returned back to society), would strengthen the persuasiveness of Nozick’s Chamberlain example and entitlement theory.  \n \n## Conclusion\nThis concludes two of Nozick’s argument against the redistributive state and my appurtenant thoughts. My conclusions are a refutation of Nozick only to the extent that they draw attention to some errors made in omission. With the appropriate revisions, some of which I’ve made suggestions for, Nozick’s two arguments--that redistribution violates the rights of the individual, and that just executions inevitably lead to just distributions--against the redistributive state will be strengthened.  \n\n[^1]: Robert Nozick 1974: Anarchy, State, and Utopia.

One way or another, I got to thinking: *do **all** things necessarily have a beginning?*\n\nFor all physical things and processes, we can confidently say there is a beginning. The laptop on which I write this had, in some sense, a beginning—assembled from components, those from raw materials, and those from the Earth. My own corporeal self began at birth, preceded by my conception, preceded by my parents, and so on. Concepts are trickier, but they too seem to originate somewhere: the concept of love, for instance, could be said to arise when sentient, social beings first experience attachment, care, and longing. Time too, often thought a concept, I've read characterized through physical terms; that it is the direction of the increase of entropy within a system. (Carlo Rovelli's \"The Order of Time\" was a fascinating read.)\n\nIt seems, then, that many things have a beginning \"through inheritance”—by which I mean that because something is situated in or predicated on a physical system, it inherits that system's origin. My being is a link in a long causal chain that stretches back to the Big Bang—or whatever primal event science one day settles on.\n\nSo, do *all* things have a beginning, given that we suppose the universe itself began?\n\nI think the answer is no. To see this, consider the concept of **zero**.\n\nUnlike physical objects or even social phenomena like love or justice, zero is not a presence but an *absence*. It is not just a placeholder in arithmetic, but a way of *thinking about nothing*. And that makes it strange. We cannot say it \"came into being\" in the same way a pancake or an organism did. Even saying it was \"invented\" by the Babylonians or Indians or anyone else is misleading—it was *recognized*, perhaps formalized, but not conjured from nothing.\n\n## Mathematics: Zero as Axiomatic Void\n\nIn mathematics, zero is not merely a numeral but an **axiomatic anchor**. It defines the baseline of quantity, the identity element of addition, and the boundary between the positive and the negative. It's embedded in our number systems, but its existence precedes any formal system. Even before its notation, zero functioned implicitly in problems of debt, absence, and comparison.\n\nYet what makes zero especially odd is that, unlike the natural numbers, it does not \"count\". You can't point to zero of something and show it. It's not *there*. But it is rigorously defined, indispensable, and recursively invoked in various axiomatic constructions. Zero is how we begin counting—and yet it's a count of nothing. In that sense, mathematics treats zero more like a **logical necessity**, not a temporal invention. Once again, anything countable might have a beginning, one comes into being with the first thing, two with the second, and so on and so on. Even the collection of things as expressed by sets is haunted by zero; the null (or empty) set is a subset of every possible set! No matter what your mind conjures, zero lurks!\n\n## Es Muss Sein\nZero exists because it **must**. To even say \"there is nothing\" is to invoke it. Any universe, any set of conditions, any line of reasoning presupposes the concept of none, of absence—of zero. In a sense, it is the backdrop of all beginnings, all existences, like a silent counterpart. When we say love began with the first creature capable of love, we imply that before that there was none.

By making AI models like Llama widely available, Meta is poised to benefit from the increased demand for curation, personalization, and distribution of AI-generated content. As the largest social media platform in the world, Meta is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, and its open-source approach may ultimately prove to be a savvy move that disrupts the business models of its present and would-be competitors.\n\nI've been putting Meta's Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.1-405B[^1] through its paces lately, and I've got to say I'm impressed. There's been a noticeable increase in my coding velocity on a personal project since committing myself to using Llama over the traditional Google search-and-sift-through-links for programming related queries. What I find most impressive about Llama isn't its capabilities — after all, I've had free access to Gemini Advanced (Google's best publicly available LLM offering) at work, and it's similarly effective within a professional software engineering context. Rather, what sets Llama apart to me is its being open-source, and the fact that I can tap into its largest model, with 405 billion parameters, for free, courtesy of meta.ai.\n\nNaturally, this got me thinking: what's in it for Meta? The costs of training, serving, and running inference on these models are presumably substantial. And yet, they're giving it away for free, no strings attached – not even a waitlist. All I need is an Instagram login, and I'm immediately good to go peppering Llama with questions regarding web sockets, NATS, and broker architecture design. There has to be a larger strategy at play here . . . valued at $1.29T as of today, Meta is hardly a charity, so what gives? What's the endgame? My thinking is two-parted, predicated on: (1) how LLMs lower the barrier to content creation, and (2) how LLMs might facilitate ad campaign creation. I'll tackle these related notions in turn.\n\nMultimodal generative AI has the potential to unleash a torrent of content that's not only plentiful and varied, but also of surprisingly high *quality*. I use “quality” advisedly here, acknowledging that it's a subjective term; at its worst, AI-generated content is vapid and cringeworthy, but at its best, it may be thought-provoking and genuinely impressive. In a world where AI-generated ‘slop' and gems coexist (a world we arguably already exist in), a pecuniary premium emerges on content's curation, personalization, and distribution. So, who stands to gain from this shift? One clear beneficiary is Meta; their crown jewels - Instagram and Facebook - thrive based on the engagingness of user-posted content and their ability to monetize said engagement through ads.\n\nReading (→) as “leads to” or “causes”, the causal chain for (1) is straightforward: a lower barrier to content creation → a surge in diverse content across and adapted for various formats, including text generation (e.g., marketing copy, taglines), audio, and video (script writing, captioning, multilingual translation) → an increased need for curation (filtering and organizing for specific audiences), personalization (audience relevance), and contextualization (stitching content together to make compelling narratives) → a heightened emphasis on strategic distribution, particularly on social media platforms for consumer packaged goods; targeted advertising; and ensures that quality recommendation systems remain a meaningful differentiator. I'd be remiss to not mention that through this chain, compute and accured technical competency is a transferable advantage here, applicable in non-ML or non-LLM use-cases.\n\nIt's in the above context that Meta's move to build open source models like Llama 3.1 most makes sense to me. Stratechery[^2] puts it well:\n\n>“Meta isn't selling its capabilities; rather, it sells a canvas for users to put whatever content they desire, and to consume the content created by other users. It follows, then, that Meta ought to be fairly agnostic about how and where that content is created; by extension, if Meta were to open source its content creation models, the most obvious place where the content of those models would be published is on Meta platforms. To put it another way, **Meta's entire business is predicated on content being a commodity; making creation into a commodity as well simply provides more grist for the mill**.”\n\nIt appears that Mark Zuckerberg is making a calculated bet: that the ultimate consumption of content - regardless of whether it's AI-generated or not –- will occur within Meta's properties, all of which are primed for monetization. A close reading of his letter justifying the open-sourcing of Llama[^3], ‘Why Open Source AI is Good for Meta', suggests as much. While he waxes philosophical about the virtues of open source, I'm not entirely convinced of his sincerity; I detect a hint of restrained fury, a lingering resentment towards Apple and Google, the former especially being the archetypal closed-software bully that has burned him (through Meta) in the past[^4].\n\nNow that we've examined the content side from the vantage point of Meta's users, let's turn our attention to ad creation, something supremely relevant to Meta's paying customers, its advertisers. There's reason to believe that reducing friction in ad creation -– via multimodal gen-AI –- will lead to an uptick in ad campaigns. I wouldn't be surprised if a non-trivial segment of advertisers are currently constrained by their own creative limitations and prioritization decisions, which, when taken together, relegate ad campaigns to a lower priority. This inertia can lead to a reluctance to launch ad campaigns altogether, or at the very least, a reduced willingness to engage in ongoing monitoring and A/B experimentation of existing campaigns –- a lost opportunity for ad platforms to generate additional revenue; resulting in a lower-than-desired ‘consumption' of ad campaigns. Gen-AI changes this dynamic in several ways, enabling seamless multilingual translations, allowing advertisers to reach a broader audience without the need for costly and time-consuming translation services. Additionally, gen-AI makes cross-platform ad adaptation easier, automatically adjusting ad formats and creative assets to fit the unique requirements of each platform (ad placement too). This is particularly attractive to SMBs (small businesses and individuals), who might lack the resources and expertise to manage and monitor complex ad campaigns across multiple languages and platforms. By simplifying the ad creation process and unlocking new markets, gen-AI can help SMBs reach a wider audience and drive more sales – a compelling proposition for advertisers who may have historically been deterred by the complexity and cost of ad creation. If the process were made incredibly easy -– requiring only a budget commitment and some basic parameters -– they might be persuaded to take the plunge and launch an ad campaign. With LLMs, Zuck and Meta are a step closer to total ad vertical integration and a world where they can gobble up the entirety of a business' marketing dollars. (Meta Advantage+ telegraphs this with its \"single-step automation\" for campaigns across \"audience, budget, placement, ad creative and conversion destination\").\n\nGiven our earlier suggestion that reducing friction in ad creation could lead to increased consumption of ad campaigns and potentially more bidding over specific audiences or keywords (because of an increase in demand), it's again somewhat puzzling why an open-source model of Llama would benefit the company. Why not keep it closed-source, integrate it further into their own products, and exclude others from doing the same by not providing any model for free (as they risk divulging their \"secret sauce\")? By open-sourcing Llama, Meta appears to be giving away a valuable competitive advantage, allowing other companies to integrate the model into their own ad platforms and potentially siphon off some of Meta's ad revenue. It seems counterintuitive that Meta would willingly surrender this opportunity for exclusivity and revenue growth. Here too, the (reasonable) assumption that most terminal/ultimate consumption happens within Meta's properties applies. Just as content is inevitably posted and published in either Facebook, Instagram, or sent over Whatsapp, ad campaigns might inevitably and finally occur through Meta's ad network (or Google's, as the ad duopoly leaders). What's it to Meta if you designed your ad campaign or made your viral picture using Llama, or Gemini, or ChatGPT — so long as you publish through Meta, which you're wont to given their size of distribution, everybody wins, Meta and its advertisers most of all. Zuck again says as much in his letter: \n\n>“Selling access to AI models isn't our business model. That means openly releasing Llama doesn't undercut our revenue, sustainability, or ability to invest in research like it does for closed providers”. \n\nAnother savvy move because you can undercut competitors who do -— Amazon, Google and Microsoft all have huge cloud services that provide AI models/services to enterprises, ostensibly with a vested interest in serving their expensive models but are forced by the market to offer open source models. By open-sourcing Llama, Meta can disrupt the business model of these competitors, who rely on recouping their investment in AI research through cloud services.\n\nAI models nowadays give me the impression of a commodity. Perhaps their commodification will be permanent. Unsurprisingly, there is significant value in distribution and so the focus remains on building products that attract and retain users, as well as assembling the pieces needed to wield a dominant and durable distribution network. Meta appears well poised to take advantage of this. Good move Zuck, good move.\n\n---\n\n**Notes**\n\n[^1]: https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/\n[^2]: https://stratechery.com/2024/meta-and-open/\n[^3]: https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/\n[^4]: Apple's ATT (AppTrackingTransparency) framework that they released in 2021 systematically degraded Meta's behavioral targeting, something critical to their an monetization efficiency.

Rawls's argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the \"original position,\" in which people select what kind of society they would choose to live under if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work Political Liberalism (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life.\"\n\n---\n---\nAs moral theories related to individual liberty, Utilitarianism and\nLibertarianism fall on opposite ends of the spectrum. With that said, and in\nlight of their respective pros and cons, perhaps there’s a balance to be struck\nbetween extreme equality on one end and extreme individual liberty on the other.\nThis is the sort of question asked by John Rawls when it comes to the question\nof justice. In line with the Contractarian tradition, Rawls puts forth his own\nconception of justice--namely, “justice as fairness”, the descriptor of a\nsocial contract in which notions of fairness and reciprocity are embedded. Like\nthe Utilitarians before him, Rawls asks what general principles of justice ought\nto structure a society of free and equal individuals. Stemming from his own\nintuition as to what is reasonable, Rawls says that a just society would be\nfounded on two principles of justice: one related to equal rights of liberty,\nand another to equality of opportunity and economic security.[^1]  \n\nIn order to mediate between a society of free individuals and his principles of\njustice, Rawls employs a thought experiment from which fair and spontaneous\nagreement on these principles emerges, the so-called original position. In\nbrief, Rawls’ thought experiment asserts that when mutually disinterested—but\nnot egoist—participants are deprived of knowledge of their personal\ncharacteristics, circumstances, and conceptions of good, they will rationally\nselect his two principles concerning liberty of equality with impartiality and\nunanimity.[^2] That these two principles are selected spontaneously in this\noriginal position is to Rawls indicative of their role as fundamental principles\nof justice.  \n\nI will first elaborate Rawls’ two principles of justice and provide my own\ncommentary as to why they are reasonable. I will then turn my attention to the\noriginal position and here also argue its reasonableness. For much of this\narticle, I will be defending Rawls per my belief that the limitations in his\nprinciples arise from errors in omission rather than errors in argumentation.\n(Errors made in omission tend to be easily incorporated, so long as the theory\nremains internally consistent and coherent after the fact. Errors in\nargumentation often make one’s conclusions and observations moot.) \n\nTo preempt the criticism that Rawls’ two principles of justice and mediating\noriginal position are “rigged”, I will first address the basic question of\nwhether or not either principle of justice is reasonable. (Reasonable in the\nsense that it is derived from a set of uncontroversial and coherent basic\npremises, and that it would survive the scrutiny of any reasonable person.)\nFormally, Rawls two principles of justice are given as: \n\n1. First principle. Referred to as the *greatest equal liberty principle*, Rawls\n   declares that “each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive\n   total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of\n   liberty for all.”[^3]  \n\n2. Second principle: Rawls isn’t allergic to social and economic inequalities the way strict egalitarians are, in fact, he asserts that social and economic inequalities are permissible provided they are arranged: \n   - (a) “Attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of\n     equality of opportunity.” We commonly refer to this as the *equal\n     opportunity principle*.[^4]\n\n   - (b) “To the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the\n     *just savings principle*.” (The just savings principle can be taken to mean\n     having a material respect for later generations.) We commonly refer to this\n     as the *difference principle*.[^5]  \n\nThese two principles are prioritized in the order that they appear--**(1)**,\n**(2a)**, **(2b)**. Rawls states quite literally that “a principle does not come\ninto play until those previous to it are either fully met or do not apply.”[^6]\nAs such, the basic liberties described in **(1)** cannot be compromised on the\ngrounds that there are social and economic gains to be made from **(2a)** and\n**(2b)**. This ordering follows as a matter of coherence, e.g. **(1)**\nnecessarily comes before **(2b)** because **(2b)** would be ineffective without\n**(1)**. Space will not permit me to justify the reason for this ordering\ncarefully; that said, something of a justification should become apparent as I\ndefend the reasonability of the principles themselves.  \n\nThe basic liberties that Rawls is concerned with are those of civic\nliberties--namely, freedom of speech, thought, and assembly. I will demonstrate\nthat the greatest equal liberty principle is reasonable by way of contradiction.\nWithout loss of generality, I will use the freedom of speech to arrive at a\ncontradiction. Suppose that freedom of speech is not in fact necessary to\njustice; that is, any just situation wherein someone is subsequently denied\ntheir freedom of speech remains just. Let us consider the most general\ndefinition for justice: what is just is to be whatever it means to the affected\nindividual at a given time. That we hold the affected individual to be the\nfinal—but not necessarily best—arbiter of whether or not he personally suffers\nan injustice ought to be an uncontroversial premise.[^7] Suppose further that if\nthe affected individual believes he suffers an injustice--the sort brought upon\nhim by the actions of others--he need only announce his grievance for it to\nstop. From the former two premises together, it logically follows that if we\nprevent the aggrieved from announcing their displeasure, and thus removing their\nability to vocalize and end such displeasure, we are doing an injustice upon\nthem. This result contradicts the supposition that the situation remains just\nand concludes the argument. Although this argument doesn’t demonstrate that\nfreedom of speech alone is sufficient to constitute a just society, it does show\nthat a lack of freedom of speech precludes justice. A similar argument can be\nmade for the remaining basic liberties. \n\nAs for why a just society ought to be one of equal rights over basic liberties\nis to me an uncontroversial and reasonable premise in itself. Nevertheless, my\nown reasoning mirrors that of Rawls’ comments on the original position and the\nveil of ignorance: when in a position where one’s future prospects and social\nstatus is presumably assigned according to an unknown probability distribution,\ni.e. behind the veil of ignorance in the original position, it is rational to\nseek downside protection in the form of accepting equal chances across said\npossible prospects. The logic is that because each participant is equally\nvulnerable to being the least-advantaged, they ought to, individually, have some\ninterest in protecting the least-advantaged. (Thomas Hobbes provides an\nalternative view as to why equality prevails as we are all equal in the sense\nthat “the weakest has [physical] strength enough to kill the strongest.”[^8])\n\nThe second principle is somewhat more controversial. The equality of opportunity\nis somewhat vague, although I choose to interpret it to mean “fair competition”\n--which appears to also be Rawls’ own interpretation--it could just as well\nmean “random assignment under equal chance”. Some of Rawls’ objectors assert\nthat, given one has knowledge of the degree of their talents relative to others,\nthe less-able would rationally opt for random assignments, whereas the more\ncapable would rationally opt for fair competition, resulting in a standoff that\neventuates the equality of opportunity principle to only be adopted by the\nsociety with a probability of $$\\frac{1}{2}$$. This was an objection raised by\nPaul Wolff.[^9] This particular objection, however, has already been answered in\nRawls’ later revisions, wherein he insists quite forcefully that, behind the\nveil of ignorance, participants in the original position have no knowledge as to\nwhere they fall with respect to others on the scale of natural talent and\nability.  \n\nMy own reasoning for the equal opportunity principle closely resembles the veil\nof ignorance justification for the equal right to basic liberties already\nexplored. That said, there is an additional reason for equal opportunity: equal\nopportunities to offices and positions protects an individual’s right to agency\nand autonomy over their own circumstances. Why is this desirable? I think an\neconomic argument applies here. Our (free-market) understanding of economics\nsays that high barriers to entry and unearned privilege encourage\nanticompetitive behavior, waste, and other economic inefficiencies that damage\nsociety (and eventually the individual). Conversely, low barriers to entry offer\nthe sort of competition and signaling mechanisms that most efficiently allocate\nthe capital and talents of enterprises (i.e., only the most deserving (and\npossibly most lucky) succeed). Similar meritocratic thinking applies to\n**(2a)**, open access to offices and positions ideally leads to the most\nefficient (and societally beneficial) allocation of people’s talents, with the\nadded advantage that it leads to more engaged and enterprising peoples.[^10]\n\nThe difference principle is even more difficult to justify. Rather than\ncalibrate entitlements against the state of nature, wherein life is rudimentary,\nlike Libertarians suggest, Rawls’ difference principle would have us frequently\nadjudicate in favor of the least advantaged. The absurdity of the Libertarian\ndecision to calibrate against the state of nature is easily apparent. For\nexample, it leads to the erroneous belief that full private property claims on\nnatural resources—land, for one--is just, even if private labor has only\nmarginally altered the state of nature.[^11] Certain Libertarians criticize\nRawls on the charge that his difference principle promotes laziness by taking\nfrom the hardworking to give to the allegedly “lazy” poor. Such a criticism is\nunfounded, in part because the Libertarian claims over certain types of property\n(and their concomitant unearned returns, e.g. rent) tend to be themselves\nunjust, hypocritically invalidating their claim to “hard work”, and in part\nbecause it is based on a superficial understanding of the psychology regarding\nhuman incentives and motivation to work. \n\nAccording to Rawls, any more inequality than allowed by the difference principle\nplaces demands on the least advantaged to accept inequalities that, at best, do\nnot benefit them and, at worst, leave them worse off--in turn violating the\nreciprocity that he seeks for his social contract. All this is well, an\negalitarian might say; but in the same breath she might ask: “why is *any*\ninequality permitted?” To me, the answer for this lies in a basic fact of\nbiology, with which Rawls appears to agree: an agent is only inclined to act in\na way that is antagonistic to their wants now if doing so would confer them\ngreater advantages later--upon deciding to act thusly, the agent creates some\n*value differential* across time, and to the extent that this investment is\nexpected to yield a return for the sake of its survival or comfort, the agent is\nwell within its right to make such efforts. Because all agents are at any time\ncreating differentials between themselves in the future and as they are now,\nagents will occasionally find themselves better-off or worse-off relative to\nother agents. This is a sort of inequality that is permitted (and inevitable)\nbecause it arises from the day-to-day decisions of agents, decisions for which\nwe can neither say are definitively just or unjust. Rawls abstracts further: the\nalternative of inequality, strict equality, might hamper economic growth that\ncould potentially benefit all, by reducing the incentive to apply one’s talents\nto productive ends.[^12] (Many capitalist economists believe that a rising tide\nis to the benefit of all. In my opinion, this is a sensible belief only when\ninjustices related to economic rents are compensated for.) Nevertheless, Rawls\nis in some sense more of an egalitarian than some self-described egalitarian for\nthe difference principle is motivated by the need to compensate for naturally\noccurring inequalities, e.g. inborn talents/ characteristics. Thus, despite the\nobjections of some of his critics, Rawls indeed takes into account the issue of\nthe natural lottery and its negative impact on justice. \n\nMore or less convinced that Rawls’ principles of justice are themselves\nreasonable, let us now consider the thought experiment which he holds gives rise\nto them. As I alluded to earlier, the original position is the mediating device\nemployed by Rawls to justify his two principles of justice. The original\nposition is: (1) inherently contractualist—--according to Rawls, principles of\njustice originate in social contracts because “justice as fairness assigns a\ncertain primacy to the social”;[^13] (2) consensual, in that no one is forced to\njoin, and the participants have the right to justification as to why it is in\ntheir interest to participate.   \n\nRawls’ own intuition is that political, social, and economic justice are\ngrounded in notions of fairness, social cooperation, and reciprocity,\nbackdropped by a social contract. He is not unique in his use of social\ncontracts to justify certain principles of justice. For example, the social\ncontract espoused by Locke “transpires in a state of nature among free and equal\npersons who know everything about themselves that you and I know about ourselves\nand each other.”[^14] The issue with this construction, says Rawls, is that it\ninevitably “legitimate[s] a constitutional monarchy that is in effect a\ngender-and-racially biased class state”; this remains the case even when we\nallow for the participants to start from positions of equal political rights and\nliberties. (Minority groups exchange these liberties for some of the advantages\nto be gained from civic organization and social hierarchy.) I need not explain\nthe problem in this arrangement, for it is almost a given nowadays that gender,\nsocial class, and racial classifications are not reason enough to deprive people\nof their political rights and ability to attain offices.[^15] Rawls sees an obvious\nremedy: remove the factors that are morally irrelevant or antithetical to\ndetermining just political arrangements and principles of justice. Formally,\nRawls says that when these persons are behind a “veil of ignorance” that\ndeprives them of any knowledge about their own particular characteristics,\nposition in society, and personal conceptions of good and those of others, they\nwill invariably settle on the aforementioned two principles of justice.[^16] Because\nno person can take advantage of their position to extract for themselves\nfavorable terms of cooperation, their decisions as to which principles of\njustice they wish to live under are sufficiently impartial and thus indicative\nthat these are indeed fundamental principles of justice.  \n\nSome consider the veil of ignorance to be overly restrictive to the point of\nforeclosing rational behavior. That is, if an individual has no knowledge of\ntheir fundamental values, they are supposedly psychologically incapable of\nbehaving rationally insofar that they wish to maximize their own advantage. This\nleaves Rawls’ theory of justice in something of a predicament: either the veil\nof ignorance is overly restrictive and impedes rational behavior, or it is not\nrestrictive enough to avoid the unsavory classist conclusions of Locke. I don’t\nbelieve this charge is fair; it is unclear just how necessary the knowledge of\none’s fundamental values is to achieving rational and coherent *group* behavior\nunder a social contract--consider that, whatever our fundamental values, we all\nrecognize the importance of downside protection and need for personal security\nfor the sake of social harmony.\n\nLet us conclude by recalling Rawls’ two principles of justice: **(1)** the\ngreatest equality principle states that all should have equal guarantees of the\nsame basic liberties, **(2a)** the equal opportunity principle asserts that\nsocial and economic inequalities be attached to positions and offices that are\nopen to all, and **(2b)** the difference principle claims that an inequality is\npermissible if and only if it is to the advantage of the least-advantaged. In my\njustification of the equal opportunity principle, I gave a proof by\ncontradiction argument as to why, without loss of generality, the lack of basic\nliberties such as freedom of speech constitute an injustice. On the point of\nequal access to these basic liberties, I argued that the veil of ignorance leads\none, rationally, to seek downside protection. I made a similar point to justify\nthe equal opportunity principle. As for the difference principle, I argued that\nthe Libertarian intuition to calibrate against the state of nature is wrong, and\nthat a demand for greater inequality without compensation violates reciprocity\nand places undue demands on the least-advantaged. I argued that neither strict\nequality or unbridled inequality is desirable and just on the basis of biology.\nWith that, and more or less moved by these arguments, I went on to describe\nRawls’ original position, the motivations for it, and how this social contract\ncompared to those put forth by John Locke.

It presents a series of personal annotations and critical reflections inspired by excerpts from Henry George’s seminal text, Progress and Poverty. Certain excerpts will be presented without additional commentary, allowing the power of George’s prose to speak for itself; for others, I will offer my own analysis. \n\n Anyone that knows me is aware of my deep admiration for Henry George. For his sense of justice, his precision in thinking, his capacity for writing in a manner so moving that I can’t help but feel a profound love for humanity…these reflections of mine were a long time coming. \n\n Link to a [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UNypZ9iNtV43GzjioBHN8KkwWOCxK_Hq/view?usp=sharing).\n\n---\n---\n\nThe late 19th century in America was a period of rapid industrialization: transcontinental railroads stitched together a productive nation; large machines hummed with a newfound productivity enabled by a matured petroleum industry; and awesome fortunes were amassed at an unprecedented rate. Yet, amidst this time lurked a shadow that was perplexing in its persistence: widespread poverty. This period, famously satirized by Mark Twain as the “gilded age” for its *veneer* of prosperity that served only to mask deeper social ills (Twain, 1873), heavily impacted the American-Scotch Henry George (1839-1897). An outspoken self-taught economist and journalist, George would become a vocal critic of the prevailing economic orthodoxy, exposing in detail the injustice of rent-seeking and the private capture of unearned economic rents, specifically “ground rents”.\n\nOn asking a passing teamster while traveling to San Francisco “what the land was worth there” (Dodson, 2016), George, struck by epiphany, finally had answer as to why abject poverty could be but a stone’s throw away from the greatest wealth. Here was an explanation for the inexplicable condition of Dr. Jekyll (economic progress) and Dr. Hyde (poverty) that so befuddled intellectuals: “with the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.” (Dodson, 2016). In recognizing how labor is increasingly held for ransom by rent, George undertook an independent line of inquiry without regard for the personal consequences of its conclusions, for “he who sees the truth, let him proclaim it, without asking who is for it or who is against it.”\n\nHis groundbreaking book, *Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase of Wealth: The Remedy*, is a careful examination of the root causes of inequality and economic instability within seemingly prosperous societies. In his treatise, George revives a radical solution---land value taxation---as a means to address these issues and engender a just and sound economic structure for society. My multi-part exploration will delve into the core arguments of *Progress and Poverty*: George’s examination of the seemingly paradoxical persistence of poverty amidst economic growth, his critique of prevailing economic theories, his emphasis on the “dual, not tripartite” primary division of wealth distribution, and finally an examination of the proposed solution of land value taxation. But first, let us say some more on the self-made American in order to convince ourselves of the good nature of the author whose work is under our study. In writing to his eighty-one year old father after a year and a half’s worth of toil whose final page drove him “in the dead of night [… to have] flung himself upon his knees and [weep] like a child”, Henry George wrote:\n\nIt is with deep feeling of gratitude to Our Father in Heaven that I send you a printed copy of this book. I am grateful that I have been enabled to live to write it, and that you have been enabled to live to see it. It represents a great deal of work and a good deal of sacrifice, but now it is done. It will not be recognized at first---maybe not for some time--—but it will ultimately be considered a great book, will be published in both hemispheres, and be translated into different languages. This I know, though neither of us may ever see it here. But the belief that I have expressed in this book---the belief that there is yet another life for us---makes that of little moment. \n\n As shared in “How the Book Came to Be Written” by George’s son, Henry George, Jr.\n\nGeorge believed certain economic principles which had hitherto been neglected possessed something akin to the “inevitability and infallibility of the natural law of physics” (Hehner, 1993). While such unwavering confidence is appropriately a cause for skepticism, my first introduction to George through his compiled essays *Social Problems* and his magnum opus *Progress and Poverty* revealed a compelling argument. I found myself agreeing with an appeal to not underrate our innate capacity to grasp the commonsensical, for, “while we may not be scientists or philosophers we too are men.” (George, 1892). I found myself too, swayed by the candor of his prose, utterly convinced of his good-natured humanism, and touched by the purity of his deism. (And his particular choice in epigraphs, he always picks some great ones!)\n\n*Progress and Poverty*, his first book, went on to sell “several million copies”, was translated in all the major languages, and fast became one of the best selling books of the late 1800s (Johnson, 1963). So catapulted was the celebrity of this man whose family was once in extreme privation that his popularity was rivaled only by his contemporaneous countrymen Mark Twain and Thomas Edison (Hehner, 1993). Even in more modern times, you need only read Henry George’s “Legacy” section on Wikipedia to see the prominent figures who had praise for him; sharing in my admiration are Albert Einstein, Martin Luther King, Leo Tolstoy, and Franklin D. Roosevelt (among many others). While George’s work achieved significant recognition in its time, his ideas have arguably become less prominent in contemporary economic discourse. The reasons for this relative obscurity remain a subject of debate, a topic left for the end of my series. (As a teaser: some contend that his ideas challenged the interests of powerful industrial tycoons who refused to surrender their golden-goose, i.e. rent-seeking, while others point to broader societal shifts that arguably lessened the perceived relevance of his land-centric critique, i.e. that the automobile and increasing suburbanization of America postponed the need to grapple with insensible land-use.)\n\nHumbled by the job ahead of us to connect everything together but with a complete faith that “from various instruments, set to different keys, comes the grand harmony” (George, 1878), let us begin our examination.\n\n## Book I - Wages and Capital\nBook I and II of *Progress and Poverty* proceed by first undermining the arguments used in his day to explain poverty; these chiefly being the wage-fund theory, the Malthusian doctrine and others. With the prevailing wisdom convincingly debunked, George goes on to explain poverty as the natural consequence of the private capture of economic rents (namely ground rent) for which my own discussion and treatment will be addressed in the subsequent parts of this article.\n\n### Defining Wealth and Capital: A Labor-Centric Perspective\nWealth and capital are often used interchangeably, this suffices in casual discussion. In formal contexts however, our language must be precise; a point belabored throughout the book. So let us properly define the two.\n\nTo George, “wealth […] consists of natural products that have been secured, moved, combined, separated, or in other ways modified by human exertion, so as to fit them for the gratification of human desires.” (Book I, Chapter II. The Meaning of the Terms)—wealth too is interpreted by George to be “stored up” labor, an accumulation of previous earnings just as “the heat of the sun is stored up in coal”. Wealth then is the outcome of labor’s application to natural resources which having been impressed with man’s spirit, can “minister to human desires”. Indeed, when taken globally, how enormous and endless is this desire! For “man is the only animal whose desires increase as they are fed; the only animal that is never satisfied” and for whom “the amount of wealth produced is nowhere commensurate with the desire for wealth, and desire mounts with every additional opportunity for gratification.” (Book IV, Chapter III. The Effect of the Improvements in the Arts upon the Distribution of Wealth). These quotes, as dogmatically as they are stated here, become evidently true in the many sections of the book that deal with it directly.\n\nThen what is *capital*? To George, capital is but a subset of wealth as he asserts that “all capital is wealth, all wealth is not capital”, for capital is that portion actively devoted in the aid of production, e.g. machinery, buildings, and raw materials, whose ultimate use is the creation of additional goods and services. A more subtle implication becomes apparent when we take the framing of wealth as stored-up labor to its natural conclusion: “capital is [then] but a form of labor, and its distinction from labor is in reality but a subdivision, just as the the division of labor into skilled and unskilled would be.” (Book III, Chapter VI. Wages and the Law of Wages).\n\nWhile some posit an inherent antagonism between capital and labor, with capital acting as a tyrannical oppressor, Henry George seeks to dispel this misconception. He argues that capital, far from being the enemy, is a vital tool—the laborer’s best friend---then still, labor being “deserv[ing] much the higher consideration”, as Abraham Lincoln aptly declared in his first annual address (Lincoln, 1861). Indeed, a symbiotic relationship exists: capital is not only the product and fruit of labor, but also its seed, demanding even further labor for its continued maintenance and expansion. That said, George identifies a key distortion in this dynamic when natural factors like land are introduced. The deprivation of either capital or labor, he contends, arises not from any inherent inter-conflict, but from the extraction of economic rents by landlords. These rents, levied on the land---the precursory foundation upon which both capital and labor operate---constitute an unearned gain whose private capture disrupts the natural equilibrium and hinders the just distribution of rewards. (George speaks mostly of spatial “ground rents” because of its magnitude and the diseconomies of improper land-use. However, there are other economic rents that he believes theoretically analogous.)\n\n### The Wage-Fund Theory: A Critique\nThe wage-fund theory (or doctrine) holds that wages are paid out of some pool of capital, the wages themselves being determined by the ratio of available capital to the population of workers. From this we may draw two conclusions: (1) any worker earning relatively more does so to the detriment of another worker in zero-sum competition; and (2) wages tend to the minimum as the quantity of workers outstrips its pool of available capital, i.e. a population growth exceeding capital accumulation then inevitably results in poverty wages for all. Given the assumption that this pool of capital represents a fixed fund set aside for labor’s compensation, wages as such represent the advances made by capital due to labor. In sum, this theory casts wages and profits (the returns on capital) as inherently opposed while subordinating labor to capital, downplaying the role of labor in creating value and the concept of wages as its just and proper compensation. Once again, to George, this is a classic misconception.\n\nAs an explanation for the immiseration of workers that constitutes poverty, the wage-fund theory feels intuitive in its simplicity. That said, it clumsily trips over the same obstacles as does any zero-sum analysis of wealth; notably made impotent by its spurious assumptions that an “economic pie” is fixed or that overall wages can’t grow in tandem with overall profit--—these being either tenuous or outright disproven by reality.\n\nTo reject the wage-fund theory, George tackles foremost the erroneous view that wages are drawn as an advance from capital. George argues rather, that wages are drawn instead from the increase in the general stock of wealth that is directly attributable to its concomitant labor, i.e. wages are paid out of product. Why he chooses to do so rather than just reiterate the common rebuttals will later become clear as we set up the landscape that argues labor as being the primary driver of economic value creation.\n\nWe shall see clearly that in every case in which labor is exchanged for commodities, production really precedes enjoyment; that wages are the earnings—that is to say, the makings of labor—not the advances of capital, and that the laborer who receives his wages in money (coined or printed, it may be, before his labor commenced) really receives in return for the addition his labor has made to the general stock of wealth, a draft upon that general stock […] \n\n *Chapter I. The Current Doctrine of Wages - Its Insufficiency*\n\n### Rethinking Wages: An Earned Compensation from Product\nTo convince oneself of the header’s recharacterization, we must appreciate three things:\n\n1. **Wages reflect value already created**. Earning (from labor) is synonymous to making (with labor)--—as George says, the expression “I made so and so” generally used to metaphorically mean “I earned so and so” is quite literally true economically speaking. Wages are not simply “making” money through labor; they represent compensation for value already added to the production process.\n\nIn George’s words: “As the rendering of labor precedes the payment of wages, and as the rendering of labor in production implies the creation of value, the employer receives value before he pays out value---*he but exchanges capital of one form for capital of another form*.” (Chapter III. Wages Not Drawn from Capital, but Produced by the Labor). The italicized notion of exchange here is important, it is essential to recognize the role of exchange within this system. Though money, particularly digital currency within online bank accounts, may obscure the underlying reality, all economic transactions ultimately represent a barter in the material domain. Similar to the laws of thermodynamics, wealth is not destroyed in an exchange, but rather transformed. Spending currency, whether physical or digital, signifies the exchange of an IOU against the collective wealth denominated in some currency (e.g. the US dollar) for a tangible good (e.g. a Rolex). The market dictates the dynamic pricing of these goods, just as it influences the value of the currency itself, but the fact remains that its utility eventually comes down to a greater or weaker claim on any *physical* good or service. Double-entry bookkeeping might capture this exchange, reflecting the *transfer* of value from one form (US dollars) to another ( Rolex) within an individual’s cash and inventory accounts (as opposed to its *destruction*).\n\n2. **Wages are properly the recognition of an increase in wealth**. Traditionally, wages are viewed as an “advance” from a pre-existing pool of capital. However, a more accurate perspective suggests wages as an obligation or draft upon the newly created wealth. As labor is applied, the overall stock of wealth increases and so wages represent a rightful claim on this newly created value, not a loan or advance from any fixed pool.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, wages can demonstrably be viewed as a form of post-facto compensation for value creation already realized through labor. The sequential relationship being one wherein the value created from the application of labor to the material precedes the payment of wages. Wages are thus not an advance on future production or capital, but rather a retrospective recognition of economic value already or currently added. What’s more, the value is continuous and additive throughout production (supposing labor is always productive) and while the incremental value creation can be interrupted by depreciation or entropy, the core principle remains---labor continuously adds value until the good or service reaches its final state. Where, once at said final state, the good or service possesses its final market value, i.e. its (marginal) utility, and thus reflects the culmination of all labor inputs through the chain of production. (Indirect labor in the way of managerial, design, or operational work are contributions that can be considered among more direct labor inputs.) Even partially completed goods or gathered materials embody an inherent value due to the labor already invested, in Newton’s parlance, they possess a *vis insita* of a different sort. When we acknowledge the continuous nature of value creation and the sequential relationship between labor and wages, the centrality of labor in the overall economic picture becomes evident. This perspective weakens arguments based on a fixed “wage fund” and strengthens the case for workers receiving a fair share of the value they demonstrably create, not just a portion of a pre-determined pool. George reaffirms the vital point succinctly: “no matter how long the process in which it is engaged, labor always adds to capital by its exertion before it takes from capital in its wages” (Chapter III. Wages Not Drawn from Capital but Produced by the Labor).\n\n3. **Labor and capital really represent a synergistic relationship**: the two being faces of the same coin---human exertion---destined to grow or decline in tandem. While the latter parts of this paper will delve deeper into the relationship between labor and capital, it’s crucial to acknowledge their interdependence. Capital goods (e.g. machinery and tools) undoubtedly play a role in production; however, it’s essential to recognize that the creation and maintenance of these capital goods themselves require human labor. In this way, labor can be seen as the foundational element that drives the creation and utilization of capital. This interconnectedness strengthens the argument that wages are really a recognition of the value added through the (often intentional) combined efforts of both labor and capital.\n\nHenry George was not alone in his interpretation of wages and labor. Adam Smith too emphasized the direct connection between labor and its wages. As is said by Adam Smith and repeated by George, “In that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock, the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer.” (Book I, Chapter III. Wages Not Drawn from Capital, but Produced by the Labor). In the laborer going to the unowned stream with a fishing rod of her own creation, and from her past exertion in the rod’s construction and her present exertion in fishing, her just wages are drawn directly from nature with each successful catch. In this pre-capitalist, pre-landowner scenario, the laborer is not beholden to a capitalist for her wages, but rather receives the full fruits of her labor. (When the stream is owned by a landlord, we will see how the rent unjustly takes from her wages.)\n\nIt is important to acknowledge the limitations of the current discussion: (1) thus far we’ve only focused on two (labor and capital) of the three classical factors of production: these being labor, capital, and land (or natural bounty). In linking capital and labor, we’ve come closer to George’s final contention on the actual “primary division of wealth in distribution [being] dual, not tripartite”---labor, capital (but a form of labor), and land; and (2) while its been established that labor is capital’s precursor and partner, the former being entitled to wages and the latter entitled to profits (or “interest” as we’ll see in our special treatment of capital); it is however, the third factor, land, or rather all of nature’s bounty and opportunity, that is the precursor of both. No productive enterprise can be achieved without land or its material and natural opportunity, even if trivially it refers only to the spatial volume one must occupy just to exist. In the solar system assembled in *Progress and Poverty*, land is the sun, labor the planets, and capital its moons; it is as if we are Copernicus, the solar system will become clear in due time.\n\n### Labor in Systems of Exchange\nGeorge suggests that through exchange, individuals are indirectly accessing the value created by the labor of others, essentially “trading labor for labor”; that’s to say, if some forager “digs roots and exchanges them for venison, he is in effect as truly the procurer of the venison as though he had gone in chase of the deer and left the huntsman to dig his own roots.” (Book I, Chapter I. The Current Doctrine of Wages - Its Insufficiency).\n\nAgents in early pre-currency barter systems directly exchanged products with intrinsic utility (e.g., livestock for tools). In such modes of exchange, the connection between one’s labor and the acquired good is easily apparent. However, with the development of “proto-money” (e.g. cowrie shells, precious metals and other things that were at once durable, portable and divisible), and eventually, modern currencies, this connection has become abstracted along more complex and longer chains of production and exchange.\n\nThat the “demand for consumption determines the direction [and degree] in which labor will be expended in production” (Book I, Chapter IV. The Maintenance of Laborers Not Drawn from Capital) is to me an obviously true but underrated statement (i.e. things are produced because someone demands them). I admit however that while consumer demand might set the general direction of production, other factors like efficiency, resource availability, and technological advancements may influence the “degree” of the labor equipped or willing to meet that demand.\n\nSuppose my ability to produce from my labor is varied, be it toys, furniture, or clothing. But suppose however that my demand is singular, I crave only a particular type of milk. In exerting my labor, either in the employ of another or myself, my wages are directly the product of labor in the former and money (generally speaking) in the latter. My monetary compensation reflects how society has effectively directed my labor in the satiation of another’s desires in the form of toys and furniture, and that I am paid wages links us: the reciprocative satiation of my own material desires too. George highlights this by stating that “in aiding in the production of what other producers want, [I have directed] other labor to the production of the things [I] want.” (Book I, Chapter IV. The Maintenance of Laborers Not Drawn from Capital).\n\nComplicating things somewhat is the aspect of money, for it is not entirely correct to say that the product of labor, i.e. a toy, is identical to the money I received for my labor’s value. A value which for all intents and purposes we may think as that which accumulates gradually to meet with the prevailing market price and thereafter follow. Here, money acts only as a convenient intermediary---a claim on society's “common stock” (George’s term), with which we can make financial or operational arrangements (e.g. financial derivatives or economic specialization) that do not themselves *really* constitute wealth or capital but may facilitate it. There are certain limitations to money itself, which restated, represent a claim on society’s output but may gain or lose purchasing power with its deflation or inflation. Money is a convenient means of facilitating exchange, not its source of value, for remember that the *original* source of value is the exertion of labor and whose value thereafter might be made dynamic by various other factors, the most dominant of which are the subjectivity of human desires across space and time, the variability of comparative advantage, and the quantity of physical stock marginally available for consumption, i.e. scarcity.\n\nNo nation would trade among itself for the sole purpose of money except that that money be used in the immediate employ of some useful thing, be that it may capital or wealth, for the sake of further production or consumption. That country A has given $$x$$ million dollars in aid to country B is often misleading. When we inspect more closely what that means, we find that country A has really given country B equipment, foodstuffs, clothing, etc. that are equivalent at some particular instant to $$x$$ million dollars. That it is $$x$$ million dollars at that particular time really just means it could be used to exchange for $$x$$ million dollars worth of something other than the equipment, foodstuffs, et cetera, also at that particular time. Were this a system wherein which you couldn’t exchange for anything besides the goods already mentioned or for which all production was already accounted for and at its limit, $$x$$ million dollars is an entirely meaningless term as it cannot be “spent” towards marginal production or consumption. It is similar to how a trader might rejoice at the extraordinary price his stock is trading at only to become utterly demoralized on the realization that its illiquidity means he has no counterparty to sell it to; or how a short-seller who successfully predicted and went short into nuclear armageddon would weep that the many millions of unrealized dollars in their brokerage account can fetch little else but radioactive ash. And so, even in seemingly non-labor transactions or those mediated as price in money or some other financial instrument, the underlying principle of productive exchange finally being the “trading labor for labor” persists.\n\n### A Conclusion. For now\nAnd so concludes the first part of this article. Where did we come from? We asserted repeatedly that wages are not an advance from capital but taken from the product of labor which precedes it. We affirmed that capital is but a subset of wealth, and further, a subdivision of labor---further too we affirmed the symbiotic, friendly relationship between capital and labor and alluded to the disharmonies caused by the introduction of land rents. Finally, we dealt with at length the notion that all exchange ultimately comes down to the trading of labor for labor.\n\nThe next part will focus on the next few books of *Progress and Poverty*. The first book under our future consideration is Book II which starts with a proper dismantlement of the Malthusian doctrine: first by charitably restating it, succeeded by exposing its weaknesses, and then finally putting it to rest. (Malthusianism is overwhelmingly rejected in the modern day, but was in George’s time a very influential theory that affected policy, religion and private charity. In keeping with the historical context, we’ll be careful here too in our discussion.)\n\nTill next time.\n\n---\n---\n\n### References \nProgress and Poverty. (1879).

It satisfies organizational needs for closure, accountability, and regulatory compliance. But it fundamentally misrepresents how complex systems fail.\n\nModern operations are not linear chains but **lattices** of interdependence. Failures rarely emerge from a single point of breakdown; rather, they arise from the probabilistic alignment of multiple, often mundane conditions across technical, human, and organizational domains.\n\nAs such, the “root cause” story is a narrative convenience—a way of compressing high-dimensional complexity into a single explanatory thread. More often than not, it serves to assign responsibility rather than surface truth, which explains the persistent concern that it can be misused as a vehicle for blame[^1]. As Richard Cook observed in *How Complex Systems Fail*, RCA is better understood as a social ritual than a technical discovery.\n\n[^1]: To be clear, I am attacking RCA as it's commonly practiced and institutionally mandated, **not** as it's performed by the top 1% of experts (who make up a sliver of the total RCAs produced or demanded). In talking to folks and reading, I've heard that it's been frequently misused to find a single person or component to blame so the case can be closed and everyone can get back to work.\n\nBut the deeper problem with RCA is epistemological: complex systems exhibit **emergent properties** that cannot be reduced to their constituent parts. When we insist on finding \"the\" cause, we commit what philosophers call the fallacy of misplaced concreteness: treating an analytical abstraction (the singular root) as if it were a physical reality.\n\n**Bottom Line:** The most dangerous failures do not reside in obvious broken components; they hide in the interactions between subsystems, across shifts, and within procedures that organizations fail to see until it is too late.\n\n## RCA as Dimensionality Reduction\n\nTraditional RCA is a **lossy compression algorithm**. It takes a high-dimensional event (involving hundreds of variables evolving over extended time periods) and compresses it into a low-dimensional narrative (typically one or two \"root causes\"), packaged in a report or short presentation.\n\nLike any compression algorithm, RCA preserves some information while discarding other information.\n\n**What RCA Preserves:**\n- Linear causal chains\n- Proximate temporal relationships  \n- Individual accountability assignments\n- Regulatory compliance frameworks\n\n**What RCA Discards:**\n- Non-linear interactions\n- Correlated patterns across time\n- Systemic drift and adaptation\n- “Near misses” and latent resilience\n\n**Information Theory Insight:** The information discarded by RCA is precisely the information needed to predict and prevent future failures. By compressing away the interaction patterns, we lose the ability to recognize when similar patterns are forming. This is analogous to the **lossy compression** used in JPEG images—it preserves the information humans consciously notice while discarding information that might be crucial for later machine analysis. These details, lost forever. What then is the ideal?\n\n**Ideal:** Imagine, instead, having access to the RAW footage underlying the JPEG. You can generate a JPEG, PNG, or any other format at any time while the full-resolution source remains intact, and updated on demand.\n\nApplied to industrial operations, this is what a dynamic system analysis enables:\n\n- Continuous ingestion of logs, sensor data, operator notes, and historical events.\n- On-demand exploration of the full lattice of interactions across technical, human, procedural, and organizational layers.\n- Dynamic RCA: analyses that are not fixed in time but reflect the most up-to-date operational reality, including drift, workarounds, and correlated failure patterns.\n- Preservation of high-dimensional, system-level insights that static RCA compresses away, while still producing concise, actionable outputs when needed.\n\nIn short: where traditional RCA is a JPEG, dynamic lattice analysis gives engineers access to the RAW footage that is always available, current, and queryable. This approach does not promise perfect prediction but does give the ability to understand, anticipate, and adapt to the complex interactions that drive real-world industrial failures.\n\n## The Information-Theoretic View of System Failure\n\nTo understand why lattice thinking is necessary, we must first understand what information theory tells us about complex systems.\n\nIn information theory, the complexity of a system is measured not by the number of its parts, but by the number of possible states those parts can occupy collectively, i.e. its *state space*. A system with $n$ binary components has $2^n$ possible states. As $n$ grows, the state space explodes exponentially.\n\nIndustrial systems exist in this exponential space. Consider a process unit with 1,000 monitored variables, each capable of being in one of ten discrete states (normal, high-normal, high, high-high, etc.). The total state space contains $10^{1000}$ possible configurations—a number larger than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe.\n\nMost of these states represent system failure. Only a tiny fraction represent acceptable operation. The fundamental challenge of industrial control is not preventing specific failures, but **navigating safely through an astronomical space of possible system states**.\n\n**Key Insight:** Traditional RCA examines one path through this space—the path that led to the observed failure. But there are countless other paths that could have led to failure, and countless paths that nearly led to failure but were corrected by adaptive responses. Understanding only the realized path tells us little about the structure of the space itself.[^2]\n\n[^2]: This is an important point to emphasize. A reasonable rebuttal is that any incident can be made intractable if we attempt to consider *everything*. Therefore, the best we can do is *mostly manage* things via dimensionality reduction. Given recent technology, we can certainly widen how *much* we can plausibly manage by adopting artificial intelligence and other tools that can reason through contributing factors at a scale and speed far exceeding human operators alone.\n\n## The Statistical Inevitability of Failure\n\nIndustrial systems do not fail because of negligence or misdesign alone; they fail because mathematics and the entropy of complex interactions makes failures inevitable.\n\nConsider a system with $K$ critical components, each with reliability $r$ over a given time period. The probability that all components function properly is $r^K$. For large $K$ and $r \u003C 1$, this probability collapses to zero as time extends. Perfect reliability is mathematically impossible.\n\nBut this simple model misses the crucial insight: **real systems fail not when components fail independently, but when they fail in correlated patterns**. The corollary to this is that while exhaustive enumeration of all possible failure combinations is infeasible, certain classes of failure patterns occur with disproportionately higher probability. By modeling the system as a network (read: multi-agent system) rather than a set of independent components, we gain the ability to anticipate these patterns more effectively than by focusing on individual components alone.\n\nThe mathematics of **percolation theory**[^3] provide a better model. Imagine your industrial system as a network where nodes (components, procedures, people) are connected by edges (dependencies, communications, timing relationships). The system functions when there exists a connected path from inputs to outputs through functioning nodes. System failure occurs when enough nodes fail simultaneously to break all such paths—what network theorists call a **cut set**. Importantly, there are typically many possible cut sets, most of which involve combinations of component states rather than single component failures.\n\n[^3]: See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory) for a nice overview of percolation theory: \"Assume that some liquid is poured on top of some porous material. Will the liquid be able to make its way from hole to hole and reach the bottom?\".\n\nReal operations are even more complex still: these networks are not static but time-varying multi-agent systems. At each of $M$ time steps, the network takes a different configuration, with distinct cut sets that may emerge, evolve, or disappear as operational conditions shift. It is in these dynamics—not the isolated reliability of individual parts—that the true drivers of systemic fragility reside.\n\n**Mathematical Insight:** If your system has redundancy factor $R$ (meaning $R$ independent paths must be severed to cause failure), and each path has $n$ nodes with individual failure probability $p$, then the probability of system failure is not simply related to $p$, but depends on the complex combinatorics of how paths can be severed simultaneously.\n\n**Bottom Line:** This is one way in which simple reliability calculations can mislead. They assume independence when real systems exhibit complex interdependencies.\n\n## The Thermodynamics of Operational Drift\n\nTo understand how systems drift toward failure, we can borrow concepts from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\n\nEvery operational procedure (SOPs, playbooks), equipment specification, and organizational structure represents a **constraint** that *presumably* limits the system's degrees of freedom. These constraints require energy to maintain—in the form of training, maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement.\n\nBut systems naturally tend toward **maximum entropy**—the state of maximum disorder consistent with their constraints. When maintenance energy decreases (due to resource or attention pressure), constraints slacken and the system wanders new regions of its state space.\n\nThis is **operational drift**: the gradual migration of system behavior away from design specifications and toward configurations that minimize local effort while maintaining *somewhat* functional output. This should be unsurprising as it affects all systems, especially large ones.\n\n**Thermodynamic Insight:** Drift is not a failure of human discipline—it is a fundamental physical process. Systems will drift unless energy is continuously invested to maintain constraints. The question is not whether drift will occur, but whether it will drift toward regions of greater or lesser resilience.\n\n**Practical Implication:** The most important metric in industrial operations is not uptime or efficiency, but *constraint maintenance energy* or **adherence effort** as I prefer to call it—how much effort is required to keep the system operating within its designed envelope.\n\n## The Architecture of Emergent Failure\n\nModern failures are rarely about single components—they are about the **phase transitions** that occur when multiple system parameters cross critical thresholds simultaneously. The applied maintenance effort falls below the needed **adherence effort** of the operation, after which the operation \"stumbles\" (probabilistically) into a failure mode, *eventually*.\n\nIn physics, phase transitions occur when small changes in control parameters (like temperature or pressure) cause dramatic changes in system behavior (like ice melting or a magnet losing its magnetization). The same mathematics applies to industrial systems.\n\nConsider these examples of industrial \"phase transitions\":\n\n* **Cognitive load transition**: An operator managing routine operations transitions to being overwhelmed when alarm frequency crosses a critical threshold, causing response time to increase nonlinearly.\n\n* **Maintenance backlog transition**: A maintenance organization functioning normally suddenly cannot keep pace when the rate of new work orders crosses a critical value relative to crew capacity.\n\n* **Communication bandwidth transition**: Information flow between shifts or departments functions adequately until complexity crosses a threshold where informal channels become saturated.\n\nThese transitions can be **non-linear**. Small changes in underlying parameters can cause sudden, dramatic changes in system behavior. This is why traditional linear thinking (\"a little more stress causes a little more problems\") fails to predict system breakdowns. Near these critical points, systems exhibit increased susceptibility—small perturbations that would normally be absorbed can trigger large-scale reorganization. Most industrial accidents occur when multiple subsystems are simultaneously near their critical points.\n\n## The Paradox of Functional Resilience\n\nEvery critical system exhibits what we might call *functional resilience*—the ability to maintain output despite internal degradation. Some of these adaptations are systematic; some are ad hoc, unrecorded, and eventually forgotten. Industrial operations therefore run on an invisible economy of adaptations, including:\n\n- **Maintenance workarounds:** Field modifications that keep equipment running\n- **Procedural accommodations:** Informal practices that handle edge cases\n- **Supply chain redundancies:** Multiple suppliers, safety stocks, expedited options\n- **Production quality containment:** Extra inspections, rework stations, or bypassing non-critical sensors\n- **Direct operator intervention:** Hand adjustment of feed rates, process temperature, and other process parameters to compensate for idiosyncratic equipment/plant behavior.\n\nWe can formalize this intuition with a simple relation.\n$$\n\\text{applied effort} + \\text{adaptations} \\geq \\text{adherence effort}\n$$\n\n*Applied effort* is planned, recorded labor and resources; *adaptations* are the unrecorded workarounds and compensations that operators use to maintain output. *Adherence effort* is the effort required to operate strictly according to design specifications.\n\nWhen the sum of applied effort and adaptations falls below adherence effort, the system becomes vulnerable. Crucially, because many adaptations are volatile and context-dependent, traditional metrics may overestimate robustness, masking hidden fragility. A technician leaves, firmware changes, or a temporary workaround disappears, and the apparent resilience vanishes.\n\n**The Adaptation Paradox:**\n- Systems that cannot adapt fail quickly and obviously\n- Systems that adapt too well fail slowly and invisibly\n- Optimal systems adapt just enough to handle normal variation while maintaining structural integrity\n\n**Practical Insight:** The goal is neither to eliminate adaptation (impossible) nor to allow uncontrolled adaptation (dangerous). Modern operational tools can act like a reliability engineer you can consult on demand, capturing and surfacing effective adaptations as they emerge, while highlighting which are no longer relevant. Rather than codifying these insights into rigid SOPs, they are made contextually accessible and queryable, enabling teams to channel adaptation deliberately. This preserves flexibility, reduces latent fragility, and strengthens systemic resilience—essentially giving operations a continuously updated, expert perspective on the lattice of system behaviors.\n\n\n## Why Lattice Thinking Is Theoretically Superior\n\nThe shift from root cause to lattice thinking is not merely methodological—it reflects a deeper understanding of **complex adaptive systems**.\n\n**Reductionism vs. Systems Thinking:**\n- RCA embodies **reductionist** thinking: complex phenomena can be understood by breaking them down into simple components\n- Lattice thinking embodies **systems** thinking: complex phenomena have **emergent properties** that cannot be understood from components alone\n\n**Linear vs. Non-linear Causation:**\n- RCA assumes **linear causation**: effects are proportional to causes\n- Lattice thinking recognizes **non-linear causation**: small causes can have large effects, and large causes can have small effects, depending on system state\n\n**Static vs. Dynamic Analysis:**\n- RCA provides a **static snapshot** of the failure moment\n- Lattice thinking analyzes **dynamic trajectories** through system state space over time\n\n**Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Reasoning:**\n- RCA seeks **deterministic explanations**: what happened and why it was inevitable\n- Lattice thinking uses **probabilistic reasoning**: what were the likelihood patterns and how do they suggest future vulnerabilities\n\n**Theoretical Foundation:** These differences reflect fundamental advances in our understanding of complex systems that have occurred since traditional RCA methodologies were developed. Lattice thinking incorporates insights from network theory, information theory, complexity science, and non-linear dynamics.\n\n\n## Implementation Strategy: From Root Cause to Lattice Analysis\n\n**Phase 1: Augmented RCA**\n\n* Maintain traditional RCA for regulatory compliance and reporting\n* Incorporate network mapping to capture **interaction pathways** that contributed to the incident\n* Document **near misses and successful adaptations**, preserving the system’s latent resilience for future reference\n\n**Phase 2: Probabilistic Cut Set Analysis**\n\n* Model your top operational scenarios as **dynamic networks**\n* Identify the most probable **cut sets**—combinations of failures or degraded elements that could trigger systemic issues\n* Develop monitoring and alerting mechanisms to flag when multiple elements of a cut set are simultaneously stressed\n\n**Phase 3: Dynamic Lattice Awareness**\n\n* Implement **real-time state space monitoring** to track the system’s position within its lattice of interactions\n* Provide operators and engineers with a **consultable lattice perspective**, akin to an on-demand reliability expert, that highlights emergent patterns, adaptation status, and potential cut sets\n* Train teams to interpret these lattice-level signals and respond proactively, rather than reacting to isolated component failures\n\n**Phase 4: Lattice-Informed System Design**\n\n* Redesign processes and systems with explicit attention to **network topology** and interdependencies\n* Optimize for **graceful degradation** rather than perfect prevention\n* Build **adaptive capacity** as a designed system property, ensuring the organization can absorb disturbances while maintaining functional output\n\n## Conclusion: The Mathematics of Resilience\n\nThe root cause paradigm persists because it offers cognitive closure in an uncertain world. But closure comes at the cost of understanding. By insisting on simple explanations for complex phenomena, we blind ourselves to the mathematical structures that actually govern system behavior.\n\nLattice thinking requires intellectual courage—the willingness to embrace probabilistic reasoning, non-linear dynamics, and emergent properties. It demands that we think in networks rather than chains, in state spaces rather than event sequences, in adaptation rather than prevention.\n\nBut this intellectual investment pays dividends. Organizations that understand their operational lattices or invest Lattice operational tools and platforms can:\n- **Predict vulnerabilities** before they manifest as failures\n- **Design resilience** as a fundamental system property  \n- **Adapt faster** than complexity can overwhelm them\n- **Learn systematically** from both failures and near-misses\n\nThe root cause is dead.

I am by no means a financial expert, but I want to share with you all the things I've learned about saving for retirement in the United States of 'Murica. If I've made mistakes, let me know and I'll correct them -- I invite comments! Without any further ado, let's get into it!\n\n> Money is a kind of poetry – **Wallace Stevens** \n\n## TLDR; \nAlthough retirement for the majority of us college kids is a long way off, I think it's worth familiarizing ourselves with the process. \n\n- Before thinking about investing for retirement, be sure to assess your financial situation first. For a lot of us, retirement is more than 20 years away, so meet your immediate needs first. Generally, when we say investing, we mean in the stock market. Now, remember, investing in the stock market and other securities is in no way guaranteed; in fact, investing and speculating can quite easily become synonymous – this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you **do** want your gains from being right to outweigh the costs from being wrong. It's literally the definition of profit. \n\n- Open a Roth IRA with one of Vanguard, Charles Schwab or Fidelity[^1] because these accounts provide favorable tax treatment as opposed to a regular brokerage account. You can contribute up to $6,000 per year and you can withdraw your contributions anytime restriction- and penalty-free. \n\n- Great, now that you’ve opened a Roth IRA, I suggest purchasing [ETFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) (exchange traded funds) so you have an exposure to markets and sectors as a whole as opposed to individual assets. \n\n- Keep on contributing to your account, avoid early withdrawals, take care of yourself and others, and most importantly, enjoy life ❤️\n\n---\n\nAlright, before investing in securities (tradable financial assets like bonds, stocks, etc.) markets, it’s worth assessing your financial situation. Some good considerations to make are the following – in order of priority: \n\n1. Do you have a budget? And just as important, are there ways in which you can immediately reduce any recurring expenses? Example: I realized my phone plan cost too much to justify my minimal usage, so I downgraded – that cut my monthly phone bill in half. The point isn't to deprive yourself, but to honestly evaluate you (and your dependent's) needs, and ensure that your expenditures are commensurate with the degree of those needs.\n\n2. Do you have a small emergency fund? I think it’s a good idea to have some 3 months or so worth of expenses in a checking or savings account. Some may disagree regarding how much you need to have in an emergency fund. With that said, it's also worth taking into consideration the lines of credit and/or family/friend help that you can expect in a time of personal emergency – be sure your assumptions are valid however; i.e. if you are on the hook for an unforeseen security deposit which you otherwise don’t have the cash for, you can’t assume that your sibling can front you. The pros and cons of having an emergency fund in a savings and checking account are the following:  \n   1. Savings\n      1. **Pros**: You can get an interest rate varying between 2% and 2.5% nowadays using an online bank, i.e. Ally, Discover, etc. Up to $250,000 of your deposits is federally insured in the event of the bank’s failure. \n      2. **Cons**: There is a federal limit on how often you can withdraw your funds. This limit is 6 withdrawals per month without penalty; after that, you’re charged a fee. \n   2. Checkings\n      1. **Pros**: You can easily access your money, as frequently as you like for the most part. The money is also federally insured in the event of the bank’s failure. \n      2. **Cons**: Lower interest yields, ranging from 0.01% to 0.37% at the time this was written. Because you generally access your checking account via a debit or atm card you're at greater risk for fraud and theft; so in such an event, your money will not be available while the bank investigates. Make sure you are aware of your bank’s fraud protection policy and aim to use a credit card in lieu of a debit card for day to day transactions.\n\u003Cbr/>\u003Cbr/>\n1. What is the degree of your debts?[^2] It may be worth allocating some of your cash flow towards servicing the interest on the debts or paying down the debt principal altogether. If you have “favorable\" loans which accrue interest only once you’ve graduated, it makes a lot of sense to pay down as much as the principal as early as possible. I’m not American nor am I outwardly political, but please don’t bet on your student loans being forgiven in the next four or so years. That is, irrespective of what the forgive-college-student-debt, and the opposing camp say, maintain the course, but remain vigilant and flexible. \n\nDon’t take any of the above as hard requirements (except taxes and any usurious debt 😔). These really are just considerations, and you can pretty much do ‘em all at the same time; especially if you have an income while you're in college; i.e. x% goes towards your emergency fund, y% goes toward paying down debts, and you ‘unlock’ z% after having reduced an expense. \n\n### Saving for Retirement \nAlrightio! once you feel comfortable saving for retirement and other large goals, opening a Roth IRA is an excellent option. (To be clear, you may never feel \"ready\", but 'tis life). Now, full disclaimer: investing in securities such as bonds, stocks and etc. are never without risk; there is always the chance that you will lose both your profits and the principal amount that you’d invested. Statistics and Machine Learning notwithstanding, we generally say that historical returns/profits are not fully indicative of future returns and profit. Finally, I, Mohamadou Bella Bah, am not responsible for your investment performance and/or resultant financial situation, that includes the good (yay!), bad (aww) and the average (meh). As ever, be vigilant of your own financial situation and what it means in the context of the world around you. \n\nPhew, now that disclaimer™ is out of the way, let’s talk Roth. A Roth IRA is an investment account that offers you favorable tax treatment. Every year, you may choose to put up to $6,000 into the account and invest in whatever securities you wish – this is called a contribution. With a Roth IRA (there is another IRA, a Traditional IRA which I won’t get into here), any contribution you make has already been taxed at your current income tax rate. What this means, is that later, any earnings you make on your contributions will be tax free so long as you meet the age and/or eligibility requirements. Some of these requirements may include being 59 and ½ years old, or that you intend to use your earnings towards paying for a home or education. \n\n#### How does this differ from investing in a regular brokerage account?\n\n Mostly it comes down to how you are taxed. When you buy $500 worth of stock in say Microsoft (stock ticker symbol MSFT) in a brokerage account for example, the money you use to purchase said shares has been “already taxed” because of your income tax. While holding your stock in Microsoft, you’ll receive perhaps $10 worth of dividends (regular payments made every 3 months to shareholders), which are also taxed. When you choose to sell your MSFT stock for a capital gain (i.e. your shares are now worth $900), you’ll be taxed again. So, in a (contrived) way, there a three taxable events: purchasing the stock, receiving dividends from the stock, and later selling the stock for a gain. (Not to mention, that you may have to pay your broker a transaction fee to both purchase and sell the stock.) Within a Roth IRA, you won’t pay any taxes on the latter two events so long as you meet the eligibility requirements at the time of disbursement. \n\n I’d say there are three good financial institutions to open a Roth IRA with, these are Vanguard, Charles Schwab (what I use), and Fidelity[^1]. I highly recommend Charles Schwab, but you can’t really go wrong with any of the three. Each offers you plenty of inexpensive ETFs (these are funds that hold stock in many different assets and companies as a means of diversification. Investing in individual stocks as a capital limited investor can be risky – or so goes the general wisdom). Whichever institution you pick, I recommend purchasing the ETFs that they offer to avoid any added transaction fees, i.e. if you want to own stock in the broad US equities market, purchase VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) if using Vanguard, or SCHB (Schwab Strategic US Broad Market ETF) if using Charles Schwab. What people usually suggest is setting up a three-fund portfolio – this means within your Roth IRA, you allocate x% to US Stocks, y% to international and emerging market stocks, and z% to bonds. I did something a little bit different. \n \n#### Bella, what does your ROTH IRA look like? \n My Roth IRA looks like the following in order from smallest to largest in terms of allocation in my portfolio: \n\n- SCHE (Schwab Emerging Markets) \n- SCHF (Schwab International Equities) \n- SCHD (Schwab US Dividend Equities) \n- SCHX (Schwab US Large Cap ETF) ~ 60%\n\nNote that this is not necessarily my desired allocation (read disclaimer™). Also note that you don’t have to purchase ETFs, you can purchase individual stocks, individual bonds and etc. as you’d like, but for the diversification purposes I've already mentioned, I wouldn't recommend this. I don’t claim to be an investment expert, so it may be worth looking into what makes the most sense for you, i.e. your age, income, etc. \n\nGenerally, I strive to add $x to my account every 6 months or so (I lean more towards investing with lump-sum dollars, rather than dollar-cost averaging. See [this](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/invest-lump-sum) Vanguard article discussing the two). \n\n## Where to Next Captain? \nGoing forward, I’d suggest reading the sidebars in the personal finance subreddit [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/), and sticking to a [three fund portfolio](https://bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio). \n\nThat’s pretty much all I have to say on the topic for now. I love investing, finance and such things, so let me know if there's anything you want to discuss! \n\n---\n\n[^1]: At the time of writing, it is my and the \"online community's\" understanding that these are the best brokerages for general investing needs. \n[^2]: You might be wondering why I put debt repayment as the lowest of the three. The reason is because for loans with low interest rates, it can actually ~save~ you money in the long run to only pay the minimum monthly interest and leave the debt principal as is. For this to be true though, a few assumptions have to hold, i.e you can receive a rate of return greater than the interest rate with high probability and consistency; you are young and have a steady income. I personally believe in paying off the debt principal as quickly as possible; money not spent on interest is a guaranteed rate of return.","src/content/posts/saving-for-retirement.mdx","eded18c3ab4bfdfc","saving-for-retirement.mdx","silence-the-usurper",{"id":387,"data":389,"body":393,"filePath":394,"digest":395,"legacyId":396,"deferredRender":22},{"title":390,"date":391,"tags":392},"Silence, The Usurper",["Date","2024-08-11T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"In the hollow of his grand piano, Silence sang,\n\nEcstatic in her soundless melody,\n\nFor as time passed, a maestro’s fascination with Music’s theory,\n\nEclipsed his desire to play,\n\nHe starved her of all things: his tender touch, his adoration, his affection—\n\nAnd Music languished in a labyrinthine mind.\n\nIn oblivion came death; in death came Silence,\n\nThe grand piano an ornate casket—\n\nWith Music entombed within, Silence jubiliant without.\n\nHis fingers, once deft and sure, now stumble,\n\nOn ivory keys yellowed by disuse,\n\nNotes that once flowed in Music’s exaltation,\n\nChoke on thick cobwebs woven as a burial shroud.\n\nSilence, the usurper, draws him to her breast,\n\nThe maestro's sorrow smothered in her oppressive embrace,\n\nTragic is the murderer who mourns,\n\nRegretful of what he wrought, still yet damned is he.\n\n“She has forsaken me”,\n\n“And I am left to wonder why my heart remains”.","src/content/posts/silence-the-usurper.mdx","ec2de67094cfccf0","silence-the-usurper.mdx","sierraleone-and-her-manufactures",{"id":397,"data":399,"body":403,"filePath":404,"digest":405,"legacyId":406,"deferredRender":22},{"title":400,"date":401,"tags":402},"Sierra Leone and Her Manufactures",["Date","2020-01-21T00:00:00.000Z"],[361,123],"I had written this on January 7, 2017 while I was in Freetown, Sierra Leone. I believe this was written shortly after reading \"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\" by David Landes for the second time. \n\nThe essay's content is pretty much what the title states. It's an economic essay on Sierra Leone, her manufactures, and how to propel her to a modern economy with a strong, domestic manufacturing base. \n\nLooking back, I really don't know what to think of this unfinished, and largely unresearched essay. I'm posting it here unedited for the sake of posterity, so that I may look back at it 10 years from now, just as I am now, shaking my head saying, \"what the hell was I thinking\". (I suspect my future self is in turn going to judge 2020 Bella lol.)\n\n---\n\nDisclaimer: the essay below is **unedited**, and **unfinished**. Any present-day comments are done via footnotes. \n\n### Sierra Leone and Her Manufactures \n\nLargely an economy based in agriculture (close to 77%), Sierra Leone lacks the manufacturing industries necessary for a vibrant export economy. Such a deficiency not only endangers self-sufficiency but also impedes economic advancement. Despite its cruciality, agriculture alone cannot sufficiently expand the nation’s economy. Add to this the fact that a fifth of the country is arable and it becomes clear that stubborn specialization will prove dangerous, notwithstanding the recuperation period necessary for the land and sea; intensive farming and uncontrolled farming practices will eventually degrade the land’s utility, further aggravating the somewhat small supply. We don’t mean to disparage agriculture but rather appreciate its value; it is precisely because it is in such limited supply that Sierra Leone must greedily preserve its natural heritage. Therefore, agricultural commodities should be maintained and grown primarily for domestic use (feeding civilians, armies and such) and serve as inputs for industrial supply chains. Unrefined agricultural goods, exempting those in ample and monopoly reserve, are not intended for export; to do otherwise would impel farmers to plunder their lands in pursuit of a stronger foreign tender, a potential phenomenon that would undermine our policies on foreign exchange.  \n\nIt is of some embarrassment that Sierra Leone imports its own staple, rice; the bulk of which originates from our West African neighbor Nigeria. \n\nCertain manufactures, paramount to our nation’s sustained early improvement, must be woven into the fabric of the nation; each economic sector complementing the next, inspiring a revitalizing and wholesome synergy.  \n\nWithin the nation’s capital Freetown, street markets dominate the economy. Such employment exceeds its demand for them, resulting in congested and unsightly streets. It appears more a societal expectation to establish a shop than the logical next step after careful study and anticipation of healthy profits. Such crowded market serves to the detriment of the nation. Resources are largely squandered on duplication, having multiple structures and pertinent supply chains when one would suffice. Never equate such hectic and charged environments to a well-functioning economy; their dynamism is a euphemism for chaos. To solve the problems above (congestion, poor aesthetics, inefficiencies, overemployment, and misallocation of human/material resources) in one stroke, the surplus of market people may find better fortune and stable wages in manufacturing works. It then beggars what Sierra Leone’s manufactures are to be: \n - Rice [Exemption]  \n - Furniture \n - Jewelry [Espionage][^1]\n - Clothing \n  \nFluid credit (float government bonds) – government and the national bank – undermine and remove black market, strengthen foreign exchange  \n\nFluid credit must exist if any nation wishes to find itself competitive. As of now, the credit within Sierra Leone is informal, relying on familial ties more so than banking and government institutions. While the government seeks foreign institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, its citizens experience more difficulty in establishing formal lines of credit leaving them prone to predatory lending: usurious rates, profligacy fueled by credit and unwise lending practices.  \n\nSierra Leone’s debt is roughly a billion US dollars at the time of print. Such a debt seems easily serviceable if proper taxing and manufacturing institutions are put in place.[^2]  \n\nOf equal importance is the strengthening of our foreign exchange. To power her various industries, Sierra Leone must purchase foreign machinery, the result of our inability to produce such capital; straining her foreign exchange reserves. The underground foreign exchanges continue to undermine the efforts of our government. In exchanging Leones for foreign currencies, black market foreign exchanges enrich themselves with currencies at the time more likely to appreciate than decline in value. Foreign currencies are more impactful in the hand of a concentrated government as opposed to many small independents. Strict enforcement is unlikely to vanquish these people. A better policy would be to make it easy (near advantageous) for “JCs” (the main targets)[^3] to convert currencies in respectable banks, giving them a securer alternative to the black market. The government, through its national bank, would withhold foreign currency and reserve it for industrial and commercial capital.

For me, this moment arrived during a commute, watching a 3Blue1Brown video featuring Terence Tao[^1]. At one point, a theorem was presented (somewhat casually): *if every possible 2D projection of a convex 3D body is a perfect disk, that body must be a sphere.*\n\n[^1]: I highly encourage you to watch the video that sparked this inquiry: [Terence Tao on measuring the cosmos | The Distance Ladder Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdOXS_9_P4U).\n\nWe see it with balls and flashlights, but how can we be certain that the shadow of a sphere is *always* a perfect disk? Not just for a sphere at the origin, or a shadow on a horizontal plane, but for *any* sphere and *any* plane?\n\nCan we prove, with rigorous certainty, that the orthogonal projection of a sphere onto a plane is always a disk? I set out to answer it for myself, in hot pursuit of two distinct mathematical paths.\n\n## A Crucial Distinction: Intersection vs. Projection\n\nBefore diving into a proof, it's essential to distinguish between two related concepts:\n\n*   **Intersection**: This is the one-dimensional *slice* created when a plane cuts through a sphere. It is the curve where the two surfaces meet.\n\n*   **Projection**: This is the two-dimensional *shadow* the sphere casts on a plane from a light source at an infinite distance, where all the incident light rays are parallel and perpendicular to the plane[^2].\n\n[^2]: This \"infinitely far\" condition is crucial. A nearby light source would cast a shadow that is a different conic section—typically an ellipse. The assumption of parallel rays is the basis for an *orthographic* projection.\n\nUnderstanding the shape of the slice is the logical first step. If we can define the intersection, we can understand the projection.\n\n## The Vector Algebra Approach\n\nI wanted to sidestep purely intuitive \"it's symmetric\" arguments and construct a proof that holds for a plane of any orientation. The language of vector algebra is perfectly suited for this task.\n\n### The Setup\n\nWe can define our objects with two simple conditions:\n\n1.  **The Sphere**: A sphere centered at the origin is the set of all points $P$ in 3D space whose distance from the origin is a constant radius $r$. In vector terms:\n    $$\n    |P|^2 = P \\cdot P = r^2\n    $$\n2.  **The Plane**: An arbitrary plane[^3] passing through the origin is the set of all points $P$ whose position vectors are orthogonal to a fixed unit normal vector $n$. The condition is:\n    $$\n    P \\cdot n = 0\n    $$\n\n[^3]: This proof assumes the plane passes through the sphere's center. For a non-central plane at a distance $d$ from the origin, the intersection is still a circle, but with a smaller radius of $\\sqrt{r^2 - d^2}$. Remarkably, the projection's shadow remains a disk of radius $r$.\n\nThe intersection is simply the set of all points $P$ that satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\n### Building a Coordinate System in the Plane\n\nTo analyze the shape of the intersection, we need a coordinate system that lies *within* the arbitrary plane. We can construct one using two perpendicular unit vectors, $u$ and $v$, that span the plane.\n\n*   Let $u$ be any unit vector orthogonal to $n$.\n\n*   Let $v$ be the cross product $v = n \\times u$.\n\nThis guarantees $v$ is a unit vector orthogonal to both $n$ and $u$. Since both $u$ and $v$ are orthogonal to the plane's normal $n$, they form a basis for the plane. Any point $P$ in the plane can be written as a combination of these vectors:\n$$\nP = au + bv\n$$\nwhere $(a, b)$ are the 2D coordinates of the point within the plane's own coordinate system.\n\n### The Final Step\n\nNow, we enforce the sphere condition, $|P|^2 = r^2$, on our point in the plane:\n$$\n|au+bv|^2 = r^2\n$$\n$$\n(au+bv) \\cdot (au+bv) = r^2\n$$\nExpanding the dot product yields:\n$$\na^2(u \\cdot u) + 2ab(u \\cdot v) + b^2(v \\cdot v) = r^2\n$$\nBy our construction, $u$ and $v$ are orthonormal, meaning:\n$$\nu \\cdot u = |u|^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\nv \\cdot v = |v|^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\nu \\cdot v = 0\n$$\n\nSubstituting these values gives us the simple result:\n$$\na^2(1) + 2ab(0) + b^2(1) = r^2\n$$\n$$\na^2 + b^2 = r^2\n$$\nThis is the unmistakable equation of a circle of radius $r$. We have proven that the intersection of a sphere with any central plane is a perfect circle.\n\n## From Slice to Shadow: Proving the Projection\n\nWith the geometry of the slice confirmed, we can now tackle the shadow itself.\n\n### The Projection Formula\n\nThe orthogonal projection of any vector $P$ from the sphere's surface onto the plane is found by subtracting the component of $P$ that is parallel to the normal vector $n$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{proj}} = P - (P \\cdot n)n\n$$\nWe want to find the shape traced by $P_{\\text{proj}}$ as $P$ moves over the entire sphere. We can do this by calculating the squared distance of any projected point from the origin:\n$$\n|P_{\\text{proj}}|^2 = (P - (P \\cdot n)n) \\cdot (P - (P \\cdot n)n)\n$$\nUsing the distributive property of the dot product and the facts that $P \\cdot P = r^2$ and $n \\cdot n = 1$, the expression simplifies wonderfully:\n$$\n|P_{\\text{proj}}|^2 = r^2 - (P \\cdot n)^2\n$$\n\nIn simple terms, this equation says that the squared distance of the shadow from the center is the sphere's squared radius minus the point's squared height above the plane. This is the Pythagorean theorem in disguise.\n\n### The Conclusion\nThis final equation is powerfully conclusive. The term $(P \\cdot n)^2$ is a squared value, so it must be positive or zero. This implies a critical inequality:\n$$\n|P_{\\text{proj}}|^2 \\le r^2\n$$\nThis states that the squared distance of any point in the shadow is *less than or equal to* the squared radius of the sphere. The set of all points on a plane satisfying this condition is, by definition, a disk—a filled circle. The boundary of this disk, a circle of radius $r$, is formed by points on the sphere's \"equator\" relative to the plane, where $P \\cdot n = 0$.\n\n## An Alternate Path: The View from Spherical Coordinates\n\nDespite the ordering of this article, my first instinct was not vector algebra, but to describe the geometry using angles. This approach, using spherical coordinates, offers a different but equally compelling perspective.\n\n### The Setup\n\nWe define our point and plane using angles. The intuition is that since a plane is given by its normal vector, we can parametrize its \"tilt\" using spherical coordinates.\n\n1.  **A point on a sphere $P$**: Its location is given by spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n    $$\n    P = \\langle r\\sin\\phi\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta, r\\cos\\phi \\rangle\n    $$\n2.  **A plane through the origin**: Its orientation is defined by the fixed angles $(\\theta_0, \\phi_0)$ of its unit normal vector $n$.\n    $$\n    n = \\langle \\sin\\phi_0\\cos\\theta_0, \\sin\\phi_0\\sin\\theta_0, \\cos\\phi_0 \\rangle\n    $$\nAgain, the condition for a point to lie on the intersection is that its position vector is orthogonal to the normal vector:\n$$\nP \\cdot n = 0\n$$\n\n### The Calculation and Conclusion\n\nComputing the dot product with coordinates yields a complicated expression. After factoring and applying the cosine angle-subtraction identity, we arrive at:\n$$\n\\sin\\phi\\sin\\phi_0\\cos(\\theta - \\theta_0) + \\cos\\phi\\cos\\phi_0 = 0\n$$\nThis equation is a special case of the **Spherical Law of Cosines**[^4]. It is a more complex way of stating that $\\cos(\\gamma) = 0$, where $\\gamma$ is the angle between the vector $P$ and the normal vector $n$.\n\nWe could also recall a geometric definition of the dot product:\n\n$$\nP \\cdot n = |P| |n| \\cos\\gamma\n$$\n\n[^4]: The realization that this formula was a known identity came during my exploration of the problem.\n\nSince $|P||n| = r > 0$, the only way for the above expression to be zero is for $\\cos(\\gamma)$ to be zero; that is, the angle $\\gamma$ must be a constant 90 degrees.\n\nThis forces every point $P$ on the intersection to lie at a fixed 90° angle from the axis defined by $n$. On the surface of a sphere, the set of all points at a constant 90° angle from a central axis is, by definition, a **great circle**[^5].\n\n[^5]: A **great circle** is a circle on a sphere's surface whose center coincides with the sphere's center. If the plane does not pass through the center, the intersection is a **small circle**, like the Earth's lines of latitude.\n\n## Certainty in a Shadow\n\nMy curiosity has now been put to rest.","src/content/posts/spheres-and-shadows.mdx","57a6a2d18be1befd","spheres-and-shadows.mdx","suitors-of-the-sun",{"id":417,"data":419,"body":423,"filePath":424,"digest":425,"legacyId":426,"deferredRender":22},{"title":420,"date":421,"tags":422},"Suitors of the Sun",["Date","2024-02-17T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"**Author's note:** This poem was inspired by a quote attributed to Napoleon from a book I'd recently finished titled \"Mind of Napoleon\" compiled by J.

Variations of it can be found here https://fablesofaesop.com/the-tortoise-and-the-eagle.html.\n\n---\n---\n\nA Tortoise declared to all the small animals around him, many of which would regularly gather in crowds at the Jungle square, “O' you without shells or carapace, how do you protect yourselves?” He jeered with feigned concern, “Behold my shell. By it, I thrive in conditions you’d dare not venture, finding security where you’d tremble. I carry a fortress, and since you are regrettably without, you carry naught but a target.” There were murmurs among the smaller animals, mostly in agreement and deference to this Tortoise. Indeed he was large and great, evidenced by the fact that he'd lived many years. Certainly in comparison they were small and inconsequential.\n\nHaving watched this spectacle from above, an Eagle swooped down and alighted on a nearby branch. She cocked her head in the peculiar way eagles do, “'Lo Brother Tortoise,” interrupting the Tortoise’s lampoon, “shouldn’t we all embrace humility?”\n\n“Who is it? Is that Sister Eagle?” said the Tortoise, for he couldn’t be certain—as we know, Tortoises can only raise their necks and heads to the sky with tremendous strain; the Creator found it humorous to establish among all the animals some variety in their ability to look about; that is, to look ahead, just below, behind, at the sky, or inwards. Even man, said to be the favorite of the Creator, could not do it all. (The Creator’s favors were dolled out in a manner inscrutable to all but him.)\n\nThe Eagle dropped down to be within view of the Tortoise. She continued, her voice thoughtful and wise, “The Creator endowed us with particular strengths, but in finite measure. You, graced with age, possess strengths as numerous as the many rings in your venerable shell.” The Tortoise grinned upon hearing this. “Yet, should I task you with tallying those many rings, you’d take hours, maybe a day or so, but eventually you’d reach an end, the task fulfilled. Reflect deeply on this, Brother Tortoise, for perhaps in that end will you discover failings and shortcomings aplenty.” \n\nUnyielding in his pride, the Tortoise boasted, “My back is both home and armor, a blessing from the Creator.” He was indeed an arrogant Tortoise, having weathered many years, some good, and some bad. Moreover, he wasn’t a thinking Tortoise; in his view, only those without shells needed to rely on anything else for their security, he especially loathed that craven cleverness that compelled others to flee rather than confront danger.\n\nTo convey her lesson through demonstration, the Eagle seized a nearby Snail in her talons. Ascending to a great height, she released it, letting it plummet to the rocks below upon which it shattered into fragments just a few feet away from the onlookers below.\n\nWitnessing this, the Tortoise's expression darkened, \"Poor Brother Snail, frailer than I. Alas, this is the destiny of those without shells and feeble shells alike.” Although a haughty Tortoise, he was not without some empathy. He recalled his youth, when a gust of wind once tipped him over, exposing his soft underbelly to the beaks of Sea Birds. It was painful as his plastron had yet to harden. They pecked unsuccessfully until they grew tired and flew away in search of an easier meal. He faced defiantly to remonstrate with the Eagle, “Sister Eagle, should you drop me from your highest height—which I must add, is limited given my great weight—my shell may chip, but it is a shell that can endure many chips. Such is my pride and confidence in it--” You could almost hear the Eagle's sigh.\n\n“But, you are nearer to the heavens than I, privy to the Creator’s whispers, surely, you know things I do not!” he conceded to the surprise and delight of the Eagle. But this surprise at his newfound enlightenment and humility was to be brief, for just as the Eagle prepared to commend him, he declared, “Of course I understand the essence of your lesson! I shall anchor myself so that neither you nor anything else could ever dislodge me. I shall transform this fortress into an immovable mountain, rooted deeply into the Earth!”\n\nBefore all, the Tortoise bolted himself to the ground, enlisting the very animals he’d just derided. The Eagle waited patiently until the last manacle was shackled and the last bolt hammered deep into the ground before she chided the Tortoise. \"Truly, you are a fool. I have shown you but one way your shell acts against you. Instead of insuring yourself against its eventual failure, you have foolishly traded for more of the same. By your own doing, you’ve made the hard harder and turned what was once just plodding now thoroughly immobile. O’ you foolish Tortoise, you have prematurely fired the clay. It is vitrified and cannot be made plastic again, little else can be done now but to ground it back to powder and start anew.” The Eagle, no longer tilting her head, took to the skies in disappointment, leaving behind a beaming, misguided, and foolish Tortoise.\n\nOnce he could no longer hear the flapping wings of the Eagle, the Tortoise again requested the help of the animals in the square. He would have them remove the  bolts as he was growing hungry and was chafing from the manacles. It is in that moment, as if the Creator set out to teach the Tortoise the ultimate lesson (for he is the ultimate comedian), that a deep rumble emerged from far away in the distance. All the smaller animals scattered, fleeing in all sorts of directions into the nearby bush, and trees, and river. Left alone at the square's center was the Tortoise. Brother Elephant, startled by the voices of Man, thundered through the jungle. In his stampede and lack of attention, not hearing the meek cries below, he crushed the Tortoise. It was as it were, that an ostensibly immovable object was caught tragically beneath an unstoppable force.\n\nHigh in the sky, rather than the whispers she’d usually hear, the Eagle instead heard a wild laughter.","src/content/posts/the-tortoise-and-the-eagle.mdx","86b6b95e0f84a742","the-tortoise-and-the-eagle.mdx","tumbleweed",{"id":438,"data":440,"body":444,"filePath":445,"digest":446,"legacyId":447,"deferredRender":22},{"title":441,"date":442,"tags":443},"Tumbleweeds",["Date","2023-08-25T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"Two lovers\n    \nApart\n    \nSeparated by large and empty desert expanse\n    \nOn which the wind gently rocks tumbleweeds to and fro\n\nSo tangled so as to never unravel\n\nBetween—\n    \nTwo lovers gazing longingly at the other,\n    \nHaving taken cue from nature\n    \n*How I wish we’d tumble into tight embrace*","src/content/posts/tumbleweed.mdx","959e4b7d262ae8da","tumbleweed.mdx","webs",{"id":448,"data":450,"body":454,"filePath":455,"digest":456,"legacyId":457,"deferredRender":22},{"title":451,"date":452,"tags":453},"Webs which Bind",["Date","2025-06-03T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"Is technology not innate to us\n\nas webs are to the patient spider's craft?\n\nWe weave our networks, ever more complex,\n\nboth born of instinct, shaped by nature's law.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\nBut here we part from spider's ancient art:\n\nour webs, sprung of that same primal need,\n\nbecome the snares that hold us fast—\n\nindeed, never have I heard\n\nof a spider strangled in its silk.","src/content/posts/webs.mdx","54516c45cd73e9f5","webs.mdx","willful-arrogance",{"id":458,"data":460,"body":464,"filePath":465,"digest":466,"legacyId":467,"deferredRender":22},{"title":461,"date":462,"tags":463},"Willful Arrogance",["Date","2023-12-25T00:00:00.000Z"],[17],"There is a certain arrogance in man,\n\nThat has him believe,\n\nDespite all, that he will make it happen,\n\nBut like a deluge wherefor man would fix a dam in prevention,\n\nGod humbles him,\n\nFor God intended man prostrate and not dictate the universe.\n\nBut there are times,\n\nWhen the will of man is so concentrated as to be made potent,\n\nAnd his soul cries so loud,\n\nThat the hearing God obligingly observes the covenant that exchanges man’s unbridled passion for His favor,\n\nSo that all that which need not happen, is rewritten to be.","src/content/posts/willful-arrogance.mdx","8e09254e771b2ffa","willful-arrogance.mdx","zion-thinking",{"id":468,"data":470,"body":474,"filePath":475,"digest":476,"legacyId":477,"deferredRender":22},{"title":471,"date":472,"tags":473},"Thinking in Zion",["Date","2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z"],[123],"**Author's note**: This article is unstructured, so handle with care as things won’t transition or segue as nicely as they could. I didn’t bother very hard to change that, it’d have been more work than it’s worth to corral everything into greater coherence. Regrettably, I made the decision to not pack a journal this trip, so I found myself forced to painstakingly ration my phone’s battery. It was just as glaringly obvious then as it is now why the written record—through pen and paper—sits nigh uncontested in the pantheon of man’s greatest inventions. All that said, everything below is inspired by my raw recollection of various trains of thought over that weekend; unsurprisingly, not every train safely made its way to a destination in the weeks that have since passed. Either way, let’s begin!\n\nLast month, I went on a backpacking trip in Zion National Park with some friends. Over three nights, we hiked Angel’s Landing and the Narrows top-down, spending a night camped along the river bank before resuming our extraterrestrial trek early morning the next day in drysuits. Despite the long drive across states (11 hours one-way in this case) and the foregone tennis playing, I value the disconnection from the portal to the internet contained within my phone. What’s more, I get to hang out with friends who I adore very much, and almost as importantly, get structured time to think. And when I say think, I mean really think: to think the sort of think that can only be *thunk* when you’ve nothing else to distract you.\n\nOn the second night, in keeping with tradition, I woke up for my nightly pee-and-stroll. What I clearly remember is having first looked up at the stars in the 5am dark, and reflecting on whether or not it was the first time I’d ever seen three stars vertically stacked atop each other. Calvin and Hobbes best describes my feelings then.\n\n![](/../../img/thinking_in_zion_post/calvin_and_hobbes_stars.jpeg)\n\n## Payments in AR\nAs I paced about, I thought about a couple things according to an agenda of sorts. The first thing on said agenda was AR glasses, “arGlasses”, but from a techno-optimistic lens. For whatever reason, payments specifically came to mind.\n\nI don’t quite know why I’m into payments. I’m certainly impressed (and rather terrified) by the durable rent-extracting duopoly created by Visa and Mastercard, plus it’s been beaten into my head that “payments is hard”. Mingled in there too might be some long-lasting feeling of rejection: I’d listened to Patrick Collison at MIT, thought “wow, what an amazing story!” only to later be rejected by Stripe for a SWE internship my undergraduate junior year (whose Dutch competitor I’m now coincidentally an investor in).\n\nEven just as an acquisition play, I imagine the question of how to seamlessly pay in an AR world is worth thinking about. I came up with more questions and room for exploration than conclusions however. I figured that QR codes (or even barcodes) could be used to trigger payment flows along with other conditions, e.g. gestures or voice commands--if beacons are used, perhaps the point-of-sale system too could act as a trigger. As far as authentication and fraud goes, retinal scanning seems plausible, or perhaps the flow (which includes authentication) would proceed more seamlessly on a companion device with existing implementations. Whatever the details of the flow could be rather straightforward, but maybe there’s opportunity in the latter part of the user journey? Here my instinct is that various deals, discounts, bundling and such can be surfaced more compellingly in AR so that it converts and upsells far more efficiently than a webpage on a phone or laptop screen—particularly for in-store purchases. Another fundamental, perhaps obvious, idea I toyed with is that arGlasses could give us a lot of room to leave considerable parts of nature and our physical environment untouched, and thus becomes interesting from an ecological preservation standpoint. \n\n## Norse poetry\nThe above ticked off only the first part of a three-part thinking agenda. Next for the night was poetry. That I like words is an understatement, I love words. A couple things had been on my mind that made me go “aha, a potential poem!\" before the trip. I’d just finished a Netflix animated series called “Twilight of the Gods” inspired by Norse Mythology and there’s a line in the series that led me to the following verse in the Havamal (a collection of Old Norse poems attributed to the Norse God Odin), it goes:\n\n>Know that I hung on a windy tree\n\n Nine long nights,\n\n Wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,\n\n Myself to myself,\n\n On that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.\n\n\nThere’s something about “myself to myself”, the implied offering of a god to himself, that so held my attention—it’s circular and feels paradoxical … it's irresistibly intriguing! Like many others, I see the parallels here between Odin and Jesus’ crucifixion in the Christian tradition. Either way, the show had me thinking of Valhalla and this idea that you fight in this world for the honor of fighting again (and again and again and again...) in the next. When I combined the aforementioned with my love for competition and its tumor-like presence in my mind, the draft of a poem materialized in my mind that night.\n\n>The Ocean’s surface is a Valhalla of sorts,\n\nFor what dies on its surface\n\nSinks to its depths,\n\nWhere it bloats and rises back up again,\n\nAs the ocean offers itself to itself\n\nThat’s where I ended with that. I didn’t like the imagery and thought it *too* direct, even if that lent itself quite nicely to the circularity of Valhalla and self-offering. As such, my mind moved to thinking about the Earth and competition. Once again, this is a draft, so a lot of the lines could use some work.\n\n>Conjured from the Earth\n\nAll things do according to their nature,\n\nVying in competition,\n\nTo the Earth, winners, losers are all the same,\n\nUpon their death, welcome and blessed with a monument.\n\nExcept for the cowards, they are rejected and cast away,\n\nNothing grows where they fell,\n\nFor how could the soulless give rise to another soul?\n\nTo not partake in nature, in competition,\n\nIs to either be a coward or wise,\n\nBut the wise know not they are, so then if you are sure\n\nVerily you are a coward,\n\nAnd so shunned will you be.\n\nWelcome by the Earth is they who try, win or lose.\n\n\nIt sucks, I’ll be the first to admit it; although I'm sure there are some interesting enough things that I'll revisit or steal for another poem or short story down the line. But as it stood, I gave up thinking about it in that night’s pacing. The stars were very beautiful to look at and I could spare no more time in my head.\n\n## The mind’s eye\nOr at least that was my genuine intention, but alas, I was a prisoner to my own agenda. I briefly considered two more things as a final hurrah: (1) a mental reminder to later think deeply on formal verification again, that is, in the context of AI systems and their outputs, and (2) Eueler’s polyhedra formula which I tried very hard to reason through and recall that night. I wrote down with the 5% charge left in my phone:\n\n>“The relation between a polyhedron, its number of faces, its edges and its points. Tried recalling it. I think for some n where n is the number of points, we can write a formula for the number of faces and number of edges.”\n\nSitting in front of a computer with Safari open, I’m reminded that the formula is written $$F + V = E + 2$$ Where $F$ is the number of faces, $V$ the number of vertices, and $E$ the number of edges. Remarkable.\n\nWhat are the motivations to the above? For (1), I’m simply interested in formally verifying AI systems and their outputs in a scalable manner. With regards to (2), it’s two-reasoned, for one, invariants, particularly topological invariants, are incredibly cool, and secondly, I’ve been trying very hard to practice visualizing and rotating shapes in my mind. I suck at it. I don’t think in pictures or videos like I know plenty folks do. I think almost strictly in words and concepts, and that happens in blank nothing. I’ve found however, that besides being very tired, I can sort of see things in my mind when I focus on doing so, especially when I close my eyes and gesticulate wildly about with my hands. I’ve talked to a couple folks about this at various times (including on this trip) and it’s always fascinating what some people are capable of seeing in their “mind’s eye”. A common thing I ask whenever this discussion comes up is to imagine an apple and the “resolution” of it. I’ve gotten answers that have ranged from a blurry 280p (a la old school YouTube) to 4k (I have to choke down my jealousy and quickly wipe away my tears). I then ask them to imagine 10 apples, what do they see? A million apples? Here I’m often told they either see a grid of apples or apples scattered all over the floor as far as they can see. An infinite number of apples? Their response doesn’t change from the million case. How about me? Well in all cases, I don’t really “see” an apple, I think of an apple, much like I don’t “see” the number 3 in my mind, nor do I see the letter “A” either. They simply just are, concepts in my mind that are entirely useless unless further prompting breathes into them some life. If I’m now told to imagine 10 apples, it’s not 10 apples that occupy my mind, but rather the instruction that the concept of 10 should now be connected to the concept of an apple. Once again, both are meaningless and don’t take any mental space until they’re made to do something interesting, e.g. “a boy is juggling 10 apples”. My mind then is a collection of many such lazily initialized instructions linking concepts. As further evidence of this, I’ll also ask folks to imagine a dog, hold it in their mind, and describe it to me with as many details as possible. Most folks I’ve asked can convincingly describe the dog as if it sits before them! they’ll tell me “yes it has a collar”, “no, it’s not leashed”, etc. I, on the other hand, if asked the same, would make up descriptions on-the-fly in order to appease you given that I can’t describe what was never there to begin with. This visually impaired style of thinking might explain a little why I’m so embarrassingly terrible at navigating without visual aids; which I might mention are really only useful to me if I can also physically manipulate and rotate them to fit any desired orientation.\n\nPhew, that was all in one night. I’ll turn to the final thoughts on that trip. This was daytime thinking, replete with many “Gedankenexperiments” (a term for conceptual thought experiments popularized by Albert Einstein) that happened the next two days while wading through the Zion narrows. I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that there was also some rather pointless thinking, for example, trying to recall what Napoleon and Alexander the Great’s horses were named. (Answer: Marengo and Bucephalus, respectively. I remembered Alexander’s but not Napoleon’s.) No matter, I bothered my friends with it all, pointful and pointless.\n\n## Physics and such\nI thought about the velocity profile of water, namely whether one could write an equation relating the height of a point in water as measured from its surface with the velocity of the water at that point (and since velocity is a vector, for any direction). I began thinking about this on first thinking about whether a homogenous (without pre-existing cracks or fractures) rock fully submerged in a stream with unidirectional constant flow could ever become anything other than one smaller rock, that is to say, could this rock become multiple rocks solely through erosion. On this question, I concluded no, as the constant flow of water on a fully submerged rock would cause mechanical weathering that could only break the rock’s surface into smaller fragments, affecting its shape and size, but never (assuming unidirectional flow) multiply the number of rocks as we visibly determine it. For there to be more than one rock, there must be a persistent and dramatic difference in the rate of weathering between some collection of points on the rock. (Under normal circumstances, a rock can become another rock due to biological activity, pre-existing fractures or cracks, chemical weathering, temperature, tumbling of the rock and collisions with other rocks, etc.) Given this belief, I then considered whether a rock underwater is, at all the points buffeted by water, possibly undergoing different rates of weathering due to differences in the speed of incoming water. Going off the previous thinking, I concluded no, that the rate of water is at all its points the same within some negligible margin. Here I was picturing the water like a bulk mass, much like a car: consider a car traveling down a road at constant 10 mph relative to some stationary observer. It should be the case that every point along its non-rotating surface also moves at 10 mph or extremely close to it. I had to rethink all this however when I observed a leaf traveling on the surface of the narrows and later still a leaf traveling beneath its surface. I attempted to be empirical here and test in the same location with roughly similar leaves their speed upon and below the water’s surface. I was not able to discover anything conclusive here but it was too late, doubt was sown. When I later had access to a charger and the internet, I found that this is well-studied. The flow velocity does indeed vary with depth and is properly called the velocity profile. There’s a lot of mathematics about it that I’ve been meaning to read but haven’t yet found the time to. I’ll need to revisit the rock multiplication question when I have.\n\nI thought too about indistinguishable particles. I’ve heard before that all electrons and protons are identical and indistinguishable from the next. Taken directly from my notes (once again, when I was able to charge and turn on my phone at dinner the next day). \n\n>“I posed the question of if given two “identical” atoms, can you determine which is which. Now, for identical objects like, 3 and 3 which both denote the number 3, or that number arrived by 1 + 1 + 1 or some myriad of other ways, I can identify either three by saying there’s a “left 3” and a “right 3”. That’s to say I’m distinguishing particles by some characteristic as to their placement in space, something extrinsic to these particles. (Which for certain particles might be impossible to measure precisely, quantum mechanics being to blame and all that). I can, however, pose the question more strongly so as to avoid such cheating, namely, given two identical particles, insofar identical as far as you can tell, can you arrange some procedure or experiment such that, when being them one at a time, may identify which is which?”\n\nMy reasoning about why this must be true was mostly because I imagined the consequences of its negation (cheating, yes). I know that particles being identical and interchangeable is of great consequence in statistical mechanics and anything else whose proof lay upon probabilistic foundations. Assuming that statistical mechanics and its results are mostly true given all that we’ve achieved with it, I concluded so too must be this assertion (nested implications). My friend insisted however that there should be some experiment that can allow one to discern between particles even in the strong-form question. Here I attempted unconvincingly to make another argument. Namely, to conduct an experiment or process to distinguish two particles, one must be able to “mark” either particle and have that mark persisted over time. This would imply that such particles possess memory and through it could theoretically behave differently to another particle in similar circumstances. The rest of the argument would be explaining why this implication is false. Given that I’m neither a physicist nor am I caught up with the latest literature on the matter, I couldn’t finish this line of thought. On these questions too I haven’t had the time to do much research, but of the cursory research (by which I mean reading the Wikipedia page on “Indistinguishable Particles”) I have done, I’m pleased to see that some of my intuition is in line with what we currently know. Once again, there’s some math here that I’d like to understand.\n\n## A not so well written conclusion\nSo ends the big things I recall thinking about on that trip. I quite frankly wish I’d thought some more. Or been more careful with my phone’s battery, or better yet, have brought a journal and a pen so I could jot things down.
